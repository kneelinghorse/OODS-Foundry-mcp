  personas:
    - name: "Hiring Panel Lead"
      role: "Director / VP of Design or Product (Design Systems / Platform focus)"
      goals:
        - "Decide in under 5–10 minutes whether Derek is a strong candidate for a senior systems role"
        - "See evidence of large-scale systems impact, not just UI polish"
        - "Understand how Derek thinks, leads, and collaborates across design, product, and engineering"
      pain_points:
        - "Most portfolios bury impact and make it hard to separate story from reality"
        - "Too much ornamental UI, not enough systems detail or organizational change"
        - "Case studies that over-index on pixels and under-index on constraints and trade-offs"
      context: >
        Arrives from a job application or referral, often between back-to-back meetings.
        Skims on laptop first, then may forward to peers or open again on a large monitor
        for deeper review.

        trust_signals:
          - "Concise, well-structured case studies with clear roles and outcomes"
          - "Architecture diagrams, naming systems, before/after states"

        - "Homepage must surface 2–3 ‘Select Systems’ projects above the fold with role + outcomes"
        - "Dedicated ‘Systems Work’ or ‘Design Systems’ path with diagrams, schemas, and code-adjacent artifacts"
        - "Quick scan routes: one-click to CV / PDF, one-click to flagship case study, one-click to writing library"

    - name: "Design Engineer / Systems Peer"
      role: "Staff+ Design Engineer, Principal IC, or Systems-minded Designer"
      goals:
        - "Understand Derek’s object-oriented and design-engineering thinking"
        - "Borrow patterns: schema, tokens, interaction patterns, pipeline setups"
        - "Gauge whether Derek’s approach aligns with their own practice"
      pain_points:
        - "Marketing-heavy sites with little technical specificity"
        - "Case studies that hide implementation details behind generic language"
        - "No clear links to repos, Storybook, or real code artifacts"
      context: >
        Often arrives via an article, a GitHub repo, or a talk mention. Comfortable with

      goals:
        - "Decide if Derek/System Systems can help modernize or build their design/system stack"
        - "See proof that Derek has shipped systems in messy, real-world constraints"
        - "Understand his engagement model: strategy, architecture, enablement, and guardrails"
      pain_points:
        - "Case-study-lite consultant sites full of generic promises"
        - "No clear throughline from diagnosis → architecture → execution → outcomes"
        - "Hard to tell if the person can navigate politics and constraints, not just design tokens"

          - "Evidence of teaching and enablement (playbooks, frameworks, talks)"
          - "A simple way to understand engagement options, not a hard sell"
      ui_implications:
        - "Homepage should explain positioning in 1–2 scrolls, with subtle but clear invitation to ‘Work together’"
        - "Narrative case studies with structured outcomes, stakeholders, and system changes"
        - "‘How I work’ section aligned to missions / OODS / CMOS, framed for exec audiences"

    imagery_style:
      photography: >
        Minimal, atmospheric shots of work surfaces, diagrams, and live systems in use;

        story strips for key projects rather than grids.
      illustrations: >
        Diagrammatic, structural, often monochrome with a single accent color; flows,
        schemas, blueprints rather than mascots.
      icons: "Simple, outlined, systems-oriented; avoid cute metaphor icons."

      easing: "Spring physics for major interactions (drawers, command menu, dock-like lists); ease-out for simple fades"
      purpose: >
        Motion exists to express system behavior (state change, hierarchy, spatial
        relationship), never as decoration. All motion must degrade gracefully and be
        soft-disabled when prefers-reduced-motion is set.

        - "Can deep-link specific sections to teammates"
      ui_implication: >

  constraints:
    technical:
      - constraint: "Site must feel like a tool, not a brochure"
        rationale: >
          Aligns with design-engineer and systems-leader audiences who expect command
          menus, dark mode, and fast interaction, not just marketing pages.
      - constraint: "Static or hybrid-rendered architecture with minimal client JS outside interactions"
        rationale: "Keeps performance, resilience, and carbon footprint in check while allowing rich micro-interactions."
      - constraint: "Design tokens and theming must align with OODS / existing token pipelines"
        rationale: "Portfolio should double as a live demonstration of Derek’s systems practice."
      - constraint: "Dual theme (light/dark) with synchronized token sets"

        requirements:
          - "Minimum 4.5:1 contrast for body text and key UI in both themes"
          - "Full keyboard operability, including command menu and any galleries or carousels"

        approach: >
          Mobile-first with layouts that preserve the tooling feel (command menu,
          archive list, select projects) even on small screens; avoid layout modes
          that only work well on 1440px+.

  accessibility_requirements:
    - id: "a11y-01-command-menu"
      summary: "Command menu and global navigation must be fully operable with keyboard and screen readers."
      rationale: >
        Command palettes and keyboard shortcuts are a core affordance for peers and

      rationale: >
        Dock-like magnification, springy drawers, hover previews, and scroll-linked
        animations are useful but non-essential; users who opt out should see a

      summary: "All brand and interaction tokens must be validated for contrast in both light and dark themes."
      rationale: >
        Yellow, amber, and mint accents are easy to misuse on light and dark backgrounds;
        explicit contrast checks are required for buttons, links, tags, and focus states.

      summary: "Use semantic landmarks and headings for all major sections, including ‘Select Systems’, library, and archive views."
      rationale: >
        High-density, tool-like layouts can become opaque if semantic structure is missing;
        screen-reader users should be able to jump between sections, lists, and filters.
