missionId: "BI-20251020-171"

objective: >
  Curate Brand and High-Contrast sections into focused proof galleries that pre-set globals and
  demonstrate the contract (interactive surfaces, status matrices, focus indicators).

context: |
  BrandA duplicates and mixed HC demos caused confusion. Replace with minimal, high-signal proofs:
  pre-set brand/theme states and show only the three HC proofs.

successCriteria:
  - "Brand: Showcase/Light/Dark/High Contrast remain as pre-set galleries (no duplicates)."
  - "High Contrast: exactly 3 stories — Interactive Surfaces (tab-through), Status Chips (matrix), Focus Indicators (grid)."
  - "Each HC story renders system-color tokens; keyboard tabbing visibly works; axe 0 violations."
  - "Removed the old #BrandA section and any redundant HC pages."

deliverables:
  - "Brand/ and High Contrast/ story files updated or replaced."
  - "docs/storybook/proofs.md describing how proofs are constructed and what to look for."
  - "artifacts/storybook/hc-proof-results.json (tab path + checks)."
