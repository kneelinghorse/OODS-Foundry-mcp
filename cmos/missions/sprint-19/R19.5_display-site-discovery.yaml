displayName: "Technical Research Mission"

missionId: "TR-20251101-195"

objective: >
  Identify the lowest-maintenance approach to publish our design system externally by evaluating static
  Storybook hosting and adjacent low-code options (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) so Sprint 19 can
  recommend an implementation path without standing up a bespoke marketing site.

context: |
  Stakeholders need an easy way to explore Component Set IV without cloning the repository. We want to
  scope a display-site strategy that keeps maintenance near-zero, respects the zero-external-dependency
  constraint for core builds, and can scale from private previews to public sharing. The research should
  capture deployment mechanics (actions, auth, secrets), hosting costs, brand considerations, and the
  review workflow for publishing updated Storybook bundles.

successCriteria:
  - "Survey at least three hosting strategies (GitHub Pages, static asset host, Chromatic/Vercel or equivalent) with pros/cons."
  - "Document deployment mechanics, required secrets, and CI hooks for each option."
  - "Evaluate maintenance overhead, governance implications, and accessibility of shared artifacts."
  - "Provide a recommended path with fallback options and decision triggers for future build work."

deliverables:
  - "This completed research brief summarizing findings, evidence, and recommended implementation path."
  - "Comparison matrix table capturing effort, cost, auth/privacy, and maintenance signals per option."
  - "Implementation notes ready to seed a follow-on build mission (B19.5)."

domainFields:
  type: "Build.TechnicalResearch.v1"

  researchQuestions:
    - "What low-code/no-code hosting options can serve our static Storybook bundle with minimal upkeep?"
    - "How do GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Chromatic, and similar services compare on deployment workflow, cost, SLA, and governance?"
    - "What automation (GitHub Actions, pnpm scripts) is required to keep the display site updated without manual intervention?"
    - "How do branding, access control, and analytics considerations influence the hosting choice?"
    - "What risks or blockers exist (e.g., asset size limits, rate limits, privacy) that could affect a Sprint 20 reviewer preview?"
