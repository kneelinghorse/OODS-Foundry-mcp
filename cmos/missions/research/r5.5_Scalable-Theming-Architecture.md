A Scalable Theming Architecture for Dark and High-Contrast Modes
Executive Summary: A Scalable Architecture for Multi-Theme UI
1.1. Primary Recommendation
This report recommends a three-tiered design token architecture implemented via CSS Custom Properties (variables). This structure serves as the single source of truth for the application's visual language. Themes, including the forthcoming Dark and High-Contrast (HC) modes, are applied by overriding a specific, semantic layer of these tokens. This approach is architecturally clean, guaranteeing that no modifications to existing component-level code are required. The result is a system that is highly scalable, maintainable, and built with a foundational commitment to accessibility standards.   

1.2. The Core Strategy
The proposed strategy layers themes logically, ensuring predictable behavior and clear separation of concerns. This model is designed for incremental implementation without disrupting the existing user experience.

Light Theme (Default): The current implementation, Theme 0, will be codified as the default set of system tokens. These variables are defined globally in the :root pseudo-class, establishing the baseline appearance of the application.   

Dark Theme (Opt-in): The dark theme is activated by adding a data-theme="dark" attribute to the <html> element. A corresponding CSS selector, [data-theme="dark"], provides the necessary specificity to override only the semantic (System) token layer. This method gives users explicit control over their theme preference, which is a more robust and flexible approach than relying solely on the prefers-color-scheme media query.   

High-Contrast Theme (User-Forced): This theme is automatically activated by the user agent when the @media (forced-colors: active) media query matches. This mode is not an aesthetic choice but a critical accessibility feature enforced by the operating system. It is designed to take absolute precedence over both light and dark themes, ensuring the user's accessibility needs are always respected.   

1.3. Key Outcomes
Adoption of this strategy will yield a robust, multi-theme system with significant technical and user-facing benefits. The system is performant, as it avoids runtime JavaScript for styling logic, limiting its role to a simple attribute toggle. It respects a spectrum of user needs, from aesthetic preference (data-theme) to OS-level accessibility mandates (forced-colors). Crucially, the architecture is designed to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA contrast requirements, with compliance continuously validated through an automated CI/CD pipeline to prevent regressions.   

A Scalable Foundation: The Three-Layer Token Model
2.1. The Why: From Hard-Coded Values to a Single Source of Truth
Modern, scalable user interfaces are built upon a systematic and shared visual language. Relying on hard-coded values (e.g., hex codes, pixel values) scattered throughout a codebase is brittle, inconsistent, and creates significant maintenance overhead. Design tokens solve this by abstracting these values into named entities, creating a single source of truth for all design decisions. This practice establishes a common language between design and engineering, streamlines handoffs, and enables system-wide visual changes to be made from one central location. A well-structured token system is the foundational prerequisite for effective theming.   

2.2. Layer 1: Reference (or Primitive) Tokens
Reference tokens are the foundational, context-agnostic values in the design system. They represent the entire available color palette and are named abstractly, based on their objective properties rather than their application or function. For example, a color is named blue-400 or gray-900, not button-background-color. This layer is the most stable and should change rarely, typically only during a major brand refresh.   

Implementation: Reference tokens are defined as CSS variables with a clear prefix to denote their layer and purpose.

CSS

/* Layer 1: Reference Tokens (e.g., /tokens/reference.css) */
:root {
  --token-ref-color-white: #FFFFFF;
  --token-ref-color-gray-50: #F9FAFB;
  --token-ref-color-gray-800: #1F2937;
  --token-ref-color-gray-900: #111827;
  --token-ref-color-blue-500: #3B82F6;
  /*... all other primitive colors */
}
2.3. Layer 2: System (or Semantic) Tokens
The system token layer is the most critical for theming. It bridges the abstract reference tokens with concrete application roles. System tokens give purpose to the primitive values by assigning them a semantic meaning, such as color-background-interactive-default or color-text-danger. This layer effectively serves as a formal API contract between the global theme and the individual components that consume it.   

The power of this architecture lies in the fact that this is the only layer that is redefined for different themes. Components are built to consume these semantic names, and theming is achieved by changing which reference token a system token points to.

Implementation: System tokens are defined by referencing Layer 1 tokens.

CSS

/* Layer 2: System Tokens (e.g., /tokens/system.light.css) */
:root {
  --token-sys-color-surface-default: var(--token-ref-color-white);
  --token-sys-color-text-default: var(--token-ref-color-gray-800);
  --token-sys-color-text-interactive: var(--token-ref-color-blue-500);
  /*... all other semantic roles for the light theme */
}
2.4. Layer 3: Component Tokens
Component tokens provide a final, optional layer of abstraction scoped to a specific UI component. For example, a button component might define --button-background-color which, in turn, consumes a system token like var(--token-sys-color-background-interactive-default). This allows for component-specific overrides without altering the global system.

However, per the mission's core constraint, this layer will not be modified. Existing components will continue to use their variables as they are. The theming mechanism works by changing the resolved value of the system tokens they already consume, ensuring perfect backward compatibility and zero component refactoring. This "abstraction firewall" is what makes adding new themes a zero-cost operation from the component's perspective, directly fulfilling the primary project requirement.

Layer Name	Purpose/Role	Example Token Name	Example Value (Light Theme)	Immutability
Reference	The raw, primitive palette. Context-agnostic.	--token-ref-color-blue-500	#3B82F6	Changes Rarely
System	Maps primitives to semantic roles. The "API" for themes.	--token-sys-color-text-interactive	var(--token-ref-color-blue-500)	Changes Per-Theme
Component	Scopes system tokens to a specific component.	--button-text-color	var(--token-sys-color-text-interactive)	Never Changes

The Core Mechanism: CSS Variable Chaining for Multi-Theme Support
The variable chaining strategy leverages the CSS cascade and specificity rules to apply themes. The light theme is established as the default, and subsequent themes are layered on top by redefining the system token layer under more specific selectors.

3.1. Defining the Default (Light Theme)
All system tokens for the default light theme are defined in the :root selector. This ensures they are globally available and have the lowest specificity, making them easy to override.   

CSS

/* /tokens/system.light.css */
:root {
  /* System Tokens (The "API") */
  --token-sys-color-surface-default: var(--token-ref-color-white);
  --token-sys-color-text-default: var(--token-ref-color-gray-800);
  --token-sys-color-focus-outline: var(--token-ref-color-blue-500);
  /*... etc. */
}
3.2. Overriding for Dark Theme
The dark theme is applied using a data-theme attribute on the <html> element. The [data-theme="dark"] attribute selector has higher specificity than :root, allowing it to cleanly override the default system tokens without affecting the base definitions.   

CSS

/* /tokens/system.dark.css */
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --token-sys-color-surface-default: var(--token-ref-color-gray-900);
  --token-sys-color-text-default: var(--token-ref-color-gray-50);
  /* Focus outline must remain visible on dark surfaces */
  --token-sys-color-focus-outline: var(--token-ref-color-blue-500);
  /*... etc. */
}
3.3. Overriding for High-Contrast (HC) Mode
The high-contrast mode is handled by the @media (forced-colors: active) media query. This is a special mode where the browser enforces a limited, user-chosen color palette. To respect this, we must override our system tokens with the official CSS System Color keywords. This ensures our UI adapts correctly to the user's OS-level accessibility settings.   

CSS

/* /tokens/system.high-contrast.css */
@media (forced-colors: active) {
  :root {
    --token-sys-color-surface-default: Canvas;
    --token-sys-color-text-default: CanvasText;
    --token-sys-color-focus-outline: Highlight;
    --token-sys-color-text-interactive: LinkText;
    /*... etc. */
  }
}
3.4. The Unchanged Component
This architecture guarantees that component styles are completely decoupled from the theming logic. A component is coded once against the semantic token API and never needs to be changed, regardless of how many themes are added.

CSS

/* /components/card.css - REMAINS UNCHANGED ACROSS ALL THEMES */
.card {
  background-color: var(--token-sys-color-surface-default);
  color: var(--token-sys-color-text-default);
  border: 1px solid var(--token-sys-color-border-default);
}

.card a {
  color: var(--token-sys-color-text-interactive);
}

.card a:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--token-sys-color-focus-outline);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
Diagram 1: The Variable Chaining Flow
The flow of values through the token system can be visualized as a directed graph, ensuring a clear and predictable cascade.

Defining the Dark Theme: A Minimal Seed and Best Practices
Creating an effective and comfortable dark theme is more nuanced than simply inverting colors. It requires a deliberate approach to color, contrast, and perceived depth to enhance usability in low-light environments.   

4.1. Core Principles of Dark Theme Design
Industry best practices from design systems like Google's Material Design provide clear guidance for creating a superior dark mode experience.

Avoid Pure Black: A pure black background (#000000) paired with white text creates the highest possible contrast, which can cause eye strain and halation (a fuzzy appearance of text). A dark gray, such as #121212, is recommended for the primary surface color. It reduces strain while still providing sufficient contrast and allows for subtle shadows to be perceptible.   

Desaturate Colors: Bright, saturated colors that work well on light backgrounds can appear to "vibrate" against a dark background, creating visual fatigue. To ensure harmony and meet accessibility standards, accent colors should be desaturated. A common practice is to use a lighter, less saturated variant of the primary brand color.   

Avoid Pure White Text: Similar to the background, pure white text (#FFFFFF) can appear too harsh. It is better to use an off-white or, more systematically, apply a level of transparency. Material Design recommends using white with 87% opacity for high-emphasis text and 60% for medium-emphasis text. This softens the text without compromising readability.   

4.2. Pitfall: Simulating Elevation without Shadows
In light UIs, box-shadow is the primary tool for communicating elevation and creating a visual hierarchy. However, shadows are largely ineffective on dark surfaces. The established best practice is to simulate elevation by adjusting surface luminance. The principle is that surfaces at a higher elevation are closer to a theoretical light source and therefore appear lighter. This is achieved by applying a semi-transparent white overlay to the base surface color. The higher the elevation, the greater the opacity of the white overlay. This creates a clear and intuitive sense of depth without relying on shadows.   

This relationship between elevation and luminance has a direct and critical impact on accessibility. As an elevated surface (like a modal dialog) becomes lighter, its contrast ratio against text of a fixed color and opacity decreases. Therefore, the base surface color (--token-sys-color-surface-default) must be selected to be dark enough that even the highest elevation surface (e.g., with a 16% white overlay) still maintains the required minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio with high-emphasis text. Failing to account for this will result in WCAG failures on crucial UI elements like dialogs, menus, and floating action buttons.

4.3. The Minimal Dark Seed
To begin the dark theme rollout, a minimal "seed" palette must be defined. This set focuses on the most fundamental UI elements required to establish a coherent dark mode experience. The full set of these tokens will be delivered in /missions/research/appendix/r5.5_theme-tokens.dark.seed.json.

Surface Colors: These define the background colors for different elevation levels.

color-surface-default: The base background of the page.

color-surface-raised: For components slightly elevated from the base, like cards.

color-surface-overlay: For components at the highest elevation, like modals or menus.

Text Colors: These define the primary content colors.

color-text-default: For standard body text.

color-text-subtle: For secondary or hint text.

color-text-on-interactive: For text on colored interactive elements like primary buttons.

Status Colors: These communicate states like success, warning, and danger.

color-background-success: For success notifications or validation.

color-background-warning: For warnings or cautionary messages.

color-background-danger: For error messages or destructive actions.

Focus Color: This is a critical accessibility token.

color-outline-focus: Defines the color of the focus ring on interactive elements. It must have strong contrast against all dark surface colors.

System Token Name	Light Theme Value (Reference)	Dark Theme Value (Reference)	Hex Value (Dark)	Rationale & WCAG Note
color-surface-default	white	gray-900	#111827	Dark gray base to reduce eye strain. Foundation for elevation overlays.
color-surface-raised	white	gray-800	#1F2937	Lighter surface to indicate elevation (e.g., cards).
color-text-default	gray-900	gray-50	#F9FAFB	Off-white text for reduced glare. Must have >= 4.5:1 contrast on all surfaces.
color-text-subtle	gray-500	gray-400	#9CA3AF	Lower emphasis text. Must have >= 4.5:1 contrast.
color-background-danger	red-100	red-900	#450A0A	Dark, desaturated red for error states. Text on this background needs to be light.
color-outline-focus	blue-500	blue-400	#60A5FA	Bright, accessible blue for focus rings. Must have >= 3:1 contrast on all surfaces.

Engineering for Accessibility: High-Contrast (HC) Mode
5.1. The forced-colors Media Query: A Mandate, Not a Preference
It is essential to distinguish between a user preference, like prefers-color-scheme, and a user-agent-enforced accessibility mode. The forced-colors: active media query signifies that the user has enabled a feature like Windows High Contrast Mode. When this is active, the browser takes control, forcibly overriding most color, background-color, box-shadow, and other decorative properties with a limited, user-defined palette. The role of the developer is not to circumvent this but to work with it, making minor adjustments to ensure the UI remains functional and legible.   

5.2. Using CSS System Colors
To align with the user's OS-level theme, we must use the standardized CSS System Color keywords. These keywords are variables whose values are supplied by the browser based on the user's active theme. Using them is non-negotiable for proper HC mode support.   

System Color Keyword	Semantic Meaning
Canvas	The background of application content.
CanvasText	The text color in application content.
LinkText	The color for unvisited links.
Highlight	The background of selected items.
HighlightText	The text color of selected items.
ButtonFace	The background color of interactive button-like elements.
ButtonText	The text color of interactive button-like elements.

Export to Sheets
5.3. The "Transparent Border" Technique for Robust UI
A significant consequence of forced-colors mode is the removal of box-shadow. Any UI that relies on shadows for borders, separation, or focus indicators will break visually. The most robust solution is the "transparent border" technique. In the base styles, an element is given a border or outline with a color of transparent. In light and dark modes, this border is invisible. However, in HC mode, the browser forces transparent to render as the system text color (CanvasText or ButtonText), which makes the border appear and restores the necessary visual boundary.   

CSS

/* Base style for a card component */
.card {
  background-color: var(--token-sys-color-surface-default);
  /* Invisible in light/dark themes, but becomes visible in HC mode */
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  /* Used for elevation in light/dark themes, but removed in HC mode */
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}

/* Base style for a focus ring */
.button:focus-visible {
  /* Invisible in light/dark, becomes Highlight color in HC mode */
  outline-color: transparent;
  /* Custom focus ring for light/dark, removed in HC mode */
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--token-sys-color-surface-default), 0 0 0 4px var(--token-sys-color-focus-outline);
}
5.4. Tie-Breaker Policy: forced-colors Always Wins
When user preferences conflict, a clear policy is required. A user enabling a system-level high-contrast mode is making an explicit and critical accessibility choice. This choice must always override any in-app aesthetic preference, such as a user-selected dark theme. The CSS architecture must reflect this hierarchy. The @media (forced-colors: active) block should be authored to ensure it has the final say on color variables, regardless of whether a data-theme="dark" attribute is present on a parent element. There is no ambiguity; the accessibility mandate takes absolute precedence.

Automated Guardrails: Accessibility Testing and Validation
To ensure our themes meet and maintain accessibility standards, an automated testing strategy is required. This strategy will establish a baseline and use differential checking to prevent regressions.

6.1. Tooling and Setup
The accessibility testing suite will be built on axe-core, the industry-standard engine that powers tools like Google Lighthouse and is maintained by Deque Systems. For robust CI/CD integration, tests will be executed using a browser automation framework like Playwright, which can programmatically interact with the page (e.g., set the data-theme attribute) before running a scan with the @axe-core/playwright package.   

6.2. Establishing the Accessibility Baseline
The current main branch, which contains only the light theme, serves as our accessibility baseline. A comprehensive axe-core scan will be run against all key user flows and components in this state. The results of this scan will be saved as a "golden record." The initial goal is to remediate any existing issues to achieve zero critical or serious violations in this baseline report.   

6.3. The Differential Test Plan
To prevent regressions, a differential testing process will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for every pull request:

Run Baseline Comparison: The CI job will check out the PR branch and run an axe-core scan against the light theme. It will compare the number of violations against the saved baseline for the main branch.

Test Dark Theme: The script will then programmatically add data-theme="dark" to the <html> element and re-run the axe-core scan on the same set of pages.

Assert No New Violations: The build will be configured to fail if the total number of new, high-impact violations (in either light or dark mode) is greater than zero. This "delta-only" approach focuses CI feedback on the changes introduced by the PR.

Automated tools like axe-core excel at finding contrast violations on solid backgrounds but can struggle with text over gradients or background images. These cases are often flagged as "needs review" rather than as definitive failures. A naive CI process that fails on any reported issue, including these reviewable items, can become "flaky" and erode developer trust. A more intelligent CI pipeline will parse the axe-core results. The build should fail (exit 1) only for violations with an impact of critical or serious. Issues marked as "needs review" should generate a non-blocking warning or a comment on the pull request, flagging them for necessary manual inspection without halting the development workflow. This ensures the CI process remains a reliable guard against clear, unambiguous regressions.   

UI Element Pair	Foreground Token	Background Token	Required Ratio	Notes
Body Text on Surface	color-text-default	color-surface-default	4.5:1	Applies to most standard text.
Large Text on Surface	color-text-default	color-surface-default	3:1	
Large text is ≥18.66px, or ≥14pt bold.

Interactive Text on Surface	color-text-interactive	color-surface-default	4.5:1	For standalone links.
Text on Interactive Background	color-text-on-interactive	color-background-interactive	4.5:1	Example: Text on a primary button.
Focus Indicator on Surface	color-outline-focus	color-surface-default	3:1	
Per WCAG non-text contrast requirements.

Input Border on Surface	color-border-default	color-surface-default	3:1	Ensures form fields are clearly visible.
  
Incremental Rollout Plan & Conclusion
A phased rollout will allow for the systematic and safe introduction of the new theming architecture and visual styles.

7.1. Phase 1: Architectural Scaffolding (1 Sprint)
Action: Convert existing hard-coded color values in the application to the three-layer token system for the light theme. Implement the JavaScript for the data-theme attribute switcher.

Goal: Deploy this foundational change with zero visual difference to the end-user. This validates the token architecture in production before any new themes are introduced.

7.2. Phase 2: Minimal Viable Dark Theme (1-2 Sprints)
Action: Define the new reference tokens for the dark palette. Implement the CSS override block [data-theme="dark"] using only the minimal seed tokens (surface, text, status, focus).

Goal: Enable the dark theme toggle. The application's main "shell" (backgrounds, body text) will appear in dark mode. Many components will still appear in light mode, but this provides the first visible milestone.

7.3. Phase 3: Full Token Coverage (Ongoing)
Action: Incrementally expand the [data-theme="dark"] override block to cover all remaining system tokens (e.g., interactive states, border colors, icons). This work can be prioritized by component usage and visibility.

Goal: Achieve full visual parity for the dark theme across all components and user flows.

7.4. Phase 4: High-Contrast Polish (1 Sprint)
Action: Once the dark theme is stable, conduct thorough manual testing in various OS-level high-contrast modes (e.g., Windows High Contrast Black/White). Implement the @media (forced-colors: active) override block, applying targeted fixes with system color keywords.

Goal: Ensure the application is fully usable and compliant in user-enforced accessibility modes.

7.5. Conclusion
This report has outlined a comprehensive and future-proof strategy for implementing multi-theme support. By adopting a layered design token architecture, we decouple the application's visual appearance from its component structure, fulfilling the core requirement of zero component-level changes. The proposed CSS variable-chaining mechanism is performant, scalable, and respects the full spectrum of user needs—from aesthetic dark mode preferences to the critical accessibility requirements of high-contrast modes. By embedding automated accessibility testing with axe-core into the CI/CD pipeline, we establish robust guardrails that will prevent contrast regressions and ensure a high-quality, inclusive user experience for all.
