missionId: "BI-20251101-193"

objective: >
  Extend automated guardrails covering metadata policy, tenancy misuse, and token governance dashboards
  so release reviewers can rely on continuous signals post-polish.

context: |
  Guardrails landed across earlier sprints (compliance, tenancy, token governance) but need consolidation
  for the release timeframe. This mission expands lint/tests, updates dashboards, and wires signals into
  diagnostics so packaging and private review have actionable health checks.

successCriteria:
  - "ESLint/ts rules updated to flag metadata policy breaches (PII, unsafe tenancy toggles) with tests."
  - "Token governance dashboard renders high-risk deltas and label state; wired into diagnostics.json."
  - "Tenancy/compliance guardrail reports integrated into artifacts/state/*.json with clear statuses."
  - "CI steps documented; failing guardrails block merge unless waived."
  - "Summary of guardrail coverage appended to docs/guardrails/overview.md."

deliverables:
  - "Lint rule updates under tools/lint-rules/* with tests in tests/lint/*."
  - "Dashboard or report updates: docs/guardrails/index.md + diagnostics.json sections."
  - "CI configuration updates (e.g., .github/workflows/* or scripts/local-pr-check.mjs)."
  - "Summary entry in docs/changelog/sprint-19.md."
