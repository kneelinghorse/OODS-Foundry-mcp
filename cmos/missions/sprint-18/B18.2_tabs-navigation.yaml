missionId: "BI-20251024-182"

objective: >
  Implement Tabs with responsive overflow handling and density variants, plus shared navigation a11y
  utilities for reuse in Pagination and Breadcrumbs builds.

context: |
  R18.1 identifies overflow menus + truncation as the preferred responsive pattern for enterprise tabs
  and mandates size variants with proper HC token hooks. Tabs must integrate with the navigation a11y
  checklist (arrow key support, aria-selected, focus management) and provide reusable utilities for
  upcoming pagination/breadcrumb missions. This build establishes the foundational tablist and overflow
  menu implementation, plus documentation for design/dev adoption.

successCriteria:
  - "Tabs component renders horizontal orientation with overflow menu, tooltip truncation, and size variants (sm/md/lg)."
  - "Keyboard interaction matches WAI-ARIA tablist (manual activation model) with arrow key navigation + aria-controls wiring."
  - "Overflow menu accessible via keyboard and screen readers; HC mode renders active indicator using border/outline tokens."
  - "Storybook stories demonstrate overflow behavior at responsive breakpoints, all sizes, disabled state, long labels."
  - "Unit/integration tests cover overflow logic, focus management, and ensures no literal colors."

deliverables:
  - "Component: src/components/tabs/Tabs.tsx + supporting hooks (useTabs, useOverflowMenu)."
  - "Utilities: src/components/navigation/a11y.ts (shared focus helpers)."
  - "Storybook: stories/components/Tabs.stories.tsx with docs + controls."
  - "Tests: tests/components/tabs.spec.tsx, including axe + keyboard coverage."
  - "Docs update: docs/components/navigation.md (tabs section)."
