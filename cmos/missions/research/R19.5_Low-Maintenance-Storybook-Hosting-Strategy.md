Technical Research: Low-Maintenance Storybook Hosting Strategy
Executive Summary & Recommendation OverviewMission Objective RecapThis report addresses mission TR-20251101-195, which tasks the identification of a low-maintenance, scalable hosting strategy for the design system's Storybook instance. The primary goal is to enable stakeholders to easily explore Component Set IV via a web interface, eliminating the need for local repository setup. The chosen solution must support a phased rollout, starting with private internal previews and scaling to public access, while adhering to a near-zero maintenance objective and a zero-external-dependency constraint for the core component build process.Primary RecommendationThis report recommends Chromatic as the optimal hosting and review platform for the design system. It is the only evaluated solution that holistically addresses the core requirements of near-zero maintenance, seamless governance, and scalable access control with minimal initial and ongoing configuration. Chromatic's purpose-built nature, as a tool created by the Storybook maintainers, provides a deeply integrated workflow that extends beyond simple hosting to encompass UI review and versioning, directly aligning with the long-term goals of a mature design system.1Key Decision FactorsThe recommendation for Chromatic is driven by its unique and superior handling of access control and governance. Its security model automatically mirrors the permissions of the source Git repository, providing a zero-effort solution for the critical "private preview" requirement.3 This contrasts sharply with the alternatives:GitHub Pages fails to meet this requirement on standard plans, gating private sites behind a cost-prohibitive enterprise plan.4Netlify and Vercel, while capable, require manual user management and introduce additional costs or configuration overhead to achieve the same level of access control.6Chromatic's approach fundamentally reduces maintenance by eliminating the need to manage a separate set of user permissions for the display site, thereby offering the most direct path to achieving the mission's primary objectives.Strategic Overview of AlternativesWhile Chromatic is the primary recommendation, other platforms offer distinct advantages and serve as strategic alternatives. Vercel stands out as the strongest fallback option due to its "Vercel Authentication" feature, which is available on its free tier and provides a robust mechanism for private previews.7 However, it introduces the overhead of managing a separate user base within the Vercel platform. Netlify is a powerful and mature platform, but its equivalent access control features are gated behind paid plans, making it less cost-effective for the initial private preview phase.6 Finally, GitHub Pages is the most cost-effective solution for public sites but is unsuitable for the required private preview stage due to its restrictive access control model.9Analysis of Hosting StrategiesThis section provides a detailed analysis of four leading hosting strategies for a static Storybook site: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and Chromatic. Each platform is evaluated against a consistent set of criteria derived from the mission objectives, including deployment mechanics, maintenance overhead, access control, cost, and performance.GitHub PagesCore Proposition & Use CaseGitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that publishes web content directly from a GitHub repository. Its core proposition is simplicity and deep integration with the GitHub ecosystem, making it an excellent choice for project documentation, personal blogs, and simple static websites.11 For Storybook, it serves as a completely free hosting solution that lives alongside the source code. The modern deployment method leverages GitHub Actions to publish a build artifact, which keeps the source repository clean by not committing the generated static files (the storybook-static directory) back into a branch.9Deployment Mechanics & AutomationAutomating Storybook deployments to GitHub Pages is achieved with a straightforward GitHub Actions workflow. This approach is superior to older methods that required committing build artifacts to a gh-pages branch, as it fully separates the source code from the deployment bundle.9The setup involves two key steps:Repository Configuration: In the repository's settings under Settings > Pages, the "Build and deployment" source must be configured to "GitHub Actions".9Workflow File: A workflow file, such as .github/workflows/deploy-ghpages.yml, must be created to define the build and deployment process. Community-developed actions like bitovi/github-actions-storybook-to-github-pages streamline this process significantly.9A typical workflow configuration is as follows:YAML#.github/workflows/deploy-ghpages.yml
name: Build and Publish Storybook to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Deploys on every push to the main branch

# Required permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN to deploy to Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.build-publish.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Add setup steps for Node.js, pnpm, and dependencies as needed
      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      # The action handles building and publishing the Storybook artifact
      - name: Build and Publish Storybook
        id: build-publish
        uses: bitovi/github-actions-storybook-to-github-pages@v1.0.3
        with:
          path: storybook-static # Default output directory for 'build-storybook'
          install_command: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
          build_command: pnpm run build-storybook
This configuration requires no manual secrets management. The necessary permissions are granted to the automatically generated GITHUB_TOKEN available to the workflow, fulfilling the id-token: write requirement for secure deployment to the GitHub Pages environment.9Maintenance Overhead & GovernanceOnce the initial GitHub Actions workflow is established, the maintenance overhead is effectively zero. Every push to the designated branch automatically triggers a build and deployment, ensuring the published Storybook is always in sync with the source code.13 Governance is implicitly tied to the repository's contribution model; any developer with permission to push to the main branch has the ability to publish updates.Access Control & Security ModelThe access control model of GitHub Pages presents a significant and decisive limitation for this project's requirements. The visibility of a GitHub Pages site is directly linked to the visibility of its source repository, with private hosting capabilities being a premium, enterprise-level feature.Public Repositories: A site generated from a public repository is always public.9Private Repositories (Standard Plans): If a repository is private and the account is on a GitHub Free, Pro, or Team plan, any published GitHub Pages site is automatically unpublished. It is not possible to host a private, access-restricted site from a private repository on these plans.10Private Repositories (Enterprise Plan): The ability to publish a private site, accessible only to organization members with read access to the repository, is exclusively available to organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.4This creates a direct conflict with the mission's requirement to "scale from private previews to public sharing." To facilitate internal stakeholder reviews during the development of Component Set IV, a private, access-controlled environment is necessary. Achieving this with GitHub Pages would mandate an upgrade to the costly GitHub Enterprise Cloud plan, an action that is disproportionate to the need for hosting a single static site. Therefore, GitHub Pages is not a viable option for the private preview phase of this project under standard GitHub plans.Branding & CustomizationGitHub Pages offers excellent support for branding and customization, which would be valuable for a future public-facing site.Custom Domains: Custom domains are fully supported at no additional cost. Configuration involves adding A, AAAA, or CNAME records in the domain provider's DNS settings to point to GitHub's servers.12HTTPS: HTTPS is automatically enforced for all GitHub Pages sites, including those using custom domains. GitHub manages the provisioning and renewal of SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring a secure connection without manual intervention.12Branding: There is no GitHub-specific branding imposed on the content of the site itself. The only default branding is the URL format (<orgname>.github.io/<repo>), which is fully replaced when a custom domain is configured.Cost Structure & ScalabilityThe primary appeal of GitHub Pages is its cost model: it is entirely free for all account types, from individual Free accounts to Enterprise plans.11 However, this is subject to specific usage limits:Site Size: Published sites may not exceed 1 GB.22Repository Size: The source repository has a recommended limit of 1 GB.22Bandwidth: A soft limit of 100 GB per month is in place.22Builds: A soft limit of 10 builds per hour applies, though this limit is waived when using a custom GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.22For a typical Storybook site, these limits are more than generous. The scalability concern is not related to traffic but to features; as established, the feature set required for private previews is not available without a significant, plan-level upgrade.Performance & ReliabilityGitHub Pages sites are served through a global Content Delivery Network (CDN), which improves load times for users around the world.25 However, GitHub does not publish specific performance metrics, global Points of Presence (PoPs), or an official Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the uptime or availability of the Pages service.22 Anecdotal evidence and documentation suggest that deployments can take up to 10 minutes to fully propagate across the CDN, which may introduce a minor delay for reviewers after a code push.4NetlifyCore Proposition & Use CaseNetlify is a sophisticated cloud platform engineered for building, deploying, and scaling modern web applications, with a strong emphasis on the Jamstack architecture.27 It extends far beyond simple static hosting, offering a suite of integrated services such as serverless functions, edge logic, form handling, and authentication. For deploying Storybook, Netlify serves as a high-performance static asset host with a deeply integrated and automated CI/CD pipeline that connects directly to a Git provider.30Deployment Mechanics & AutomationNetlify's deployment workflow is designed for simplicity and automation. The primary method involves linking a GitHub repository directly to a Netlify site through its web UI.Connect Repository: In the Netlify dashboard, create a "New site from Git" and authorize access to the desired GitHub repository.30Configure Build Settings: Specify the build command and the publish directory. For a standard Storybook project using pnpm, these would be:Build command: pnpm run build-storybook 30Publish directory: storybook-static/ 30Manage Secrets: Any necessary environment variables (secrets) can be securely added in the Netlify site's settings (Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment).33This setup leverages Netlify's own build environment, which automatically detects pushes to the production branch and pull requests, triggering builds and creating unique "Deploy Previews" for each change.34 This largely obviates the need for a custom GitHub Actions workflow for standard deployments. For more advanced, version-controlled configuration, a netlify.toml file can be added to the root of the repository.Maintenance Overhead & GovernanceThe ongoing maintenance for a Netlify-hosted Storybook is low. Once the initial connection and build settings are configured, the deployment process is fully automated. Governance is managed within the Netlify platform through its team and role-based access control system. This is distinct from GitHub permissions; access to deploy the site or change its settings is determined by a user's role within the Netlify team (e.g., Owner, Collaborator), not their access to the GitHub repository.6 This separation can add a minor layer of administrative overhead, as two sets of permissions must be managed.Access Control & Security ModelNetlify provides robust and flexible options for restricting access to sites, which directly addresses the project's private preview requirement. However, these critical features are not available on the free tier.Basic Password Protection: This feature protects a site (or specific deploys like previews) with a single, shared password. It is available on the Pro plan and higher.6Team Login Protection: This more secure option requires visitors to authenticate with their Netlify team credentials. It is ideal for internal previews, ensuring only designated team members can access the site. This is also available on the Pro plan and higher.6SSO Protection: For enterprise-grade security, sites can be protected via a third-party identity provider, which requires an Enterprise plan.6The free "Starter" plan does not include any built-in password or team-based protection.8 While community workarounds exist, such as using client-side encryption tools like staticrypt during the build process, they introduce additional complexity, require managing encryption keys as secrets, and can provide a clunky user experience.33 Such a solution would violate the "near-zero maintenance" objective. Therefore, to properly fulfill the private preview requirement using Netlify's native, well-supported features, an upgrade to the Pro plan is necessary.Branding & CustomizationNetlify excels in branding and domain management.Custom Domains: Custom domains can be easily added to any site, including on the free tier.35 Netlify provides clear instructions for configuring both Netlify DNS (by changing nameservers) and external DNS (by adding A and CNAME records).38HTTPS: Free, automated SSL/TLS certificates are provided for all sites via Let's Encrypt, ensuring all custom domains are served securely over HTTPS.35Branding: The default site URL includes Netlify branding (e.g., your-site.netlify.app), but this is completely removed once a custom domain is configured. There is no other Netlify branding injected into the deployed site.36Cost Structure & ScalabilityNetlify's pricing combines plan-based subscriptions with usage-based billing, recently transitioning to a "credits" system that abstracts various metrics.Free Plan: The free tier is generous for personal projects and public sites, offering 300 build minutes per month and 100 GB of bandwidth.35 It is limited to one team member and does not support private repositories owned by an organization.39Pro Plan: Starting at $20 per member per month, this plan is required for team collaboration, connecting to private organization repositories, and accessing key features like Password Protection.35 The Pro plan includes significantly higher usage limits, such as 1 TB of bandwidth and 25,000 build minutes.28Scalability: Costs scale with the number of team members and resource consumption (builds, bandwidth, function invocations).28 This model provides flexibility but can also lead to unpredictable costs for high-traffic or build-intensive projects.Performance & ReliabilityNetlify's infrastructure is built on a high-performance global CDN known as "Netlify Edge," designed for low latency and high availability.29CDN Architecture: The platform uses atomic deployments and instant cache invalidation, ensuring that updates are propagated globally without risk of serving stale content.41 The standard network boasts an 80% cache hit rate.41SLA: A formal 99.99% uptime SLA is available, but this guarantee is exclusive to the Enterprise plan.41 The Free and Pro plans do not come with a contractual uptime guarantee.High-Performance Edge: An upgraded enterprise-tier network is available, offering up to 50% faster response times, more global PoPs, proactive DDoS mitigation, and a 95% cache hit rate.41VercelCore Proposition & Use CaseVercel is a leading cloud platform for frontend developers, providing a seamless workflow to build, deploy, and scale web applications.43 As the creators of the Next.js framework, Vercel offers unparalleled integration for Next.js projects, but it also serves as a powerful and highly performant host for static sites, including Storybook instances.45 Its core proposition is a developer-centric experience, a global edge network, and robust CI/CD capabilities.Deployment Mechanics & AutomationDeploying a static Storybook site to Vercel requires a slightly different approach than deploying a framework Vercel recognizes natively. The process involves connecting a GitHub repository and providing explicit build instructions via a vercel.json configuration file.Connect Repository: Import the project into Vercel by connecting to the GitHub repository via the Vercel dashboard.45Create vercel.json: Because Storybook is not a framework with a zero-configuration Vercel preset, a vercel.json file must be created in the root of the repository to instruct Vercel on how to build the site.45JSON{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "framework": null,
  "installCommand": "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile",
  "buildCommand": "pnpm run build-storybook",
  "outputDirectory": "storybook-static"
}
This file explicitly tells Vercel to bypass its framework detection ("framework": null) and use the specified commands and output directory.45 Secrets are managed as Environment Variables within the Vercel project's settings. Once configured, Vercel's CI/CD pipeline automatically handles deployments on pushes and pull requests.Maintenance Overhead & GovernanceThe maintenance overhead for Vercel is low, comparable to Netlify. The primary maintenance task is ensuring the vercel.json file remains synchronized with the project's build process. Governance is managed through Vercel's team system, which is separate from GitHub permissions. Vercel offers roles such as Owner, Member, and Viewer (a free, read-only role) to control access to project settings and deployments.47Access Control & Security ModelVercel's "Deployment Protection" features provide a compelling solution for the private preview requirement, with a key feature available on its free plan.Vercel Authentication: This feature restricts access to deployments to members of the Vercel team. When a visitor accesses a protected URL, they are prompted to log in with their Vercel account. Critically, Vercel Authentication is available on all plans, including the free Hobby plan.7 This allows the project to invite stakeholders as free "Viewers" to the Vercel team, granting them access to private previews at no cost.Password Protection: A simpler, shared-password mechanism is also available. However, this is considered an "Advanced Deployment Protection" feature and is only available on the Enterprise plan or as a paid add-on for Pro plans, costing an additional $150 per month.7The availability of Vercel Authentication on the free tier is a significant advantage. It provides a secure, role-based access control system for internal previews without incurring immediate costs. This directly addresses a primary mission requirement that both GitHub Pages and Netlify's free tier fail to meet. The only trade-off is the minor administrative task of inviting stakeholders to the Vercel team and having them create free Vercel accounts.Branding & CustomizationVercel provides comprehensive support for custom branding.Custom Domains: Vercel supports custom domains on all plans. The free Hobby plan has a limit of 50 custom domains per project.52HTTPS: Automatic SSL/TLS certificates are provisioned and renewed for all custom domains, ensuring secure connections.52Branding: The default deployment URL uses the .vercel.app domain. This Vercel branding is fully removed by configuring a custom domain for the project.52Cost Structure & ScalabilityVercel's pricing model is composed of a per-seat fee for its Pro plan combined with granular, usage-based billing for infrastructure resources.Hobby Plan (Free): The free tier is generous and suitable for personal projects. It includes 100 GB of "Fast Data Transfer" (bandwidth) and other resource allowances.48 As noted, it also includes the Vercel Authentication feature.Pro Plan: This plan starts at $20 per user per month and comes with a $20 monthly credit for usage. It offers higher resource limits, team collaboration features, and faster builds.44Scalability: The highly granular, usage-based pricing for resources like function execution, image optimization, and data transfer can be powerful but also complex, potentially leading to unpredictable costs under heavy load.43 However, for a static Storybook site, usage is likely to remain well within the free or Pro tier allowances for the foreseeable future.Performance & ReliabilityVercel is architected for high performance, leveraging a global CDN and serverless compute infrastructure.CDN Architecture: Vercel's global edge network automatically caches static assets close to users for low-latency delivery. The platform is designed to be highly scalable out of the box.48SLA: A 99.99% uptime SLA is provided, but this guarantee is reserved for customers on the Enterprise plan.48 No formal SLA is offered for Hobby or Pro plans.ChromaticCore Proposition & Use CaseChromatic is fundamentally different from the other platforms evaluated. It is not a general-purpose static hosting provider but a specialized, all-in-one platform for developing, testing, and documenting UI components with Storybook.1 Created and maintained by the core Storybook team, its primary value lies in its deep integration into the component development workflow. It automates visual regression testing, facilitates collaborative UI review, and versions the entire UI component library.56 Hosting the static Storybook site is a feature that enables this comprehensive workflow, rather than being the end goal itself.Deployment Mechanics & AutomationDeployment to Chromatic is exceptionally streamlined and designed specifically for Storybook. The process is managed via a dedicated CLI tool and a GitHub Action.Project Setup: A new project is created in the Chromatic web UI and linked to the corresponding GitHub repository. This generates a unique project-token.56Secret Configuration: The project-token is added to the GitHub repository as a secret named CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN.15Workflow File: A simple GitHub Actions workflow using the chromaui/action@v1 action handles the entire process of building and publishing the Storybook.56A minimal workflow configuration is as follows:YAML#.github/workflows/chromatic.yml

This setup is minimal, robust, and requires no platform-specific configuration files within the repository beyond the standard workflow YAML.Maintenance Overhead & GovernanceChromatic offers the lowest maintenance overhead of all options. The entire platform is managed, and the deployment process is purpose-built for Storybook, reducing the potential for configuration drift or build issues.Its governance model is a key differentiator. Access to Chromatic projects is automatically synchronized with the permissions of the linked Git repository.3 This means there is no separate user management system to maintain for preview access. If a developer or stakeholder has access to the private GitHub repository, they automatically have access to the private Chromatic project. This perfectly aligns with existing development workflows and minimizes administrative burden.Access Control & Security ModelChromatic's access control is its most compelling feature for this project's requirements.Git-Synced Permissions: By default, a Chromatic project linked to a private GitHub repository is also private. Access is granted only to users who are collaborators on that repository.3 This provides a secure, zero-configuration solution for the "private preview" phase, available on all plans, including the free tier.Public Access: To transition to a public site, the repository's visibility can be changed to public, or a specific setting within the Chromatic project's management screen can be toggled to make the Storybook publicly accessible regardless of repository status.61Fine-Grained Roles: For external collaborators (e.g., stakeholders without GitHub access), Chromatic supports manual invitations and provides granular roles like "Owner," "Developer," "Reviewer," and "Viewer" to control their permissions within the project.3This model is superior for this use case because it leverages the existing source-of-truth for permissions—the Git repository—thus satisfying the "near-zero maintenance" objective more completely than any other solution.Branding & CustomizationCustom Domains: Chromatic supports custom domains, allowing for a fully branded URL (e.g., design-system.yourcompany.com). However, this is a premium feature available only on the Pro plan ($399/month) and higher.61HTTPS: Chromatic automatically manages SSL/TLS certificates for all domains, including custom ones.61Branding: The default Chromatic URLs are functional but not brand-friendly (e.g., main--64cde1fd944d1bae0df02169.chromatic.com).63 The Storybook itself is rendered within the Chromatic application UI, which includes Chromatic branding. While a custom domain removes the Chromatic URL, the surrounding UI remains.Cost Structure & ScalabilityChromatic's pricing model is unique among the evaluated options. It is not based on traditional hosting metrics like bandwidth or build minutes, but on "snapshots"—a unit corresponding to its visual testing features.Free Plan: Includes 5,000 snapshots per month, unlimited projects, and unlimited collaborators.62 Simply publishing a Storybook does not consume snapshots. Snapshots are only consumed when Chromatic's UI Tests or UI Review features are actively used to compare visual changes between builds. This means the free tier is highly viable for pure hosting and manual review.Paid Plans: The Starter plan ($179/month) and Pro plan ($399/month) offer significantly more snapshots, cross-browser testing, and, in the case of the Pro plan, custom domains.62Scalability: The cost scales with the team's adoption of Chromatic's advanced testing and review features. This can be seen as a "value-based" pricing model: the cost increases as the team derives more utility from the platform beyond simple hosting.Performance & ReliabilityChromatic is an enterprise-ready platform focused on reliability within the CI/CD pipeline.CDN Architecture: All published Storybooks are served via a secure, global CDN to ensure fast access for reviewers worldwide.57SLA: An official SLA is mentioned as a key feature of the Enterprise plan, along with priority support.57 No specific uptime guarantees are publicly provided for the Free, Starter, or Pro plans.Comparative Analysis & Decision MatrixSynthesis of FindingsThe analysis of the four hosting strategies reveals a clear spectrum of options, ranging from general-purpose, low-cost static hosts to a highly specialized, workflow-integrated platform.GitHub Pages is the simplest and most cost-effective solution but is immediately disqualified by its inability to support private sites on standard plans. Its utility is limited to projects that are public from day one.Netlify and Vercel represent the powerful, flexible middle ground. Both are mature platforms with excellent performance, robust CI/CD, and strong free tiers. They are highly capable of hosting a Storybook site. However, they are general-purpose tools, and achieving the required level of access control for private previews introduces friction. Netlify places this feature behind a paid plan, creating a cost barrier. Vercel offers a more elegant solution with its free Vercel Authentication, but this still necessitates managing a separate user base outside of the primary development environment (GitHub), adding a small but tangible maintenance burden.Chromatic stands apart as the specialist solution. It is designed not just to host Storybook but to enhance the entire design system workflow. Its greatest strength is its governance model, which seamlessly integrates with existing Git permissions to provide private previews with zero additional configuration. This direct alignment with the project's core requirements for low maintenance and scalable access makes it a uniquely compelling choice. The primary trade-offs are its snapshot-based pricing model, which differs from traditional hosting metrics, and the fact that custom domains are a premium, paid feature.Decision Matrix TableThe following matrix summarizes the key findings, providing a high-level comparison of each strategy against the mission's critical evaluation criteria. The signals are designed to guide the decision-making process by highlighting the most significant strengths and weaknesses of each option.Table: Storybook Hosting Strategy Comparison MatrixCriteriaGitHub PagesNetlifyVercelChromaticInitial Setup EffortLowLowLowLowOngoing MaintenanceNear-ZeroLowLowNear-ZeroFree Tier ViabilityLimited (Blocked by private preview req.)Viable (But no native auth)Excellent (Vercel Auth included)Excellent (Git-based auth included)Cost (Scaling Model)Free (Plan-based for features)Per User + UsagePer User + UsageSnapshot-based (Workflow usage)Auth/Privacy (Private Previews)Enterprise OnlyPaid Feature (Pro Plan)Free (Vercel Auth)Free (Mirrors Git Repo)Workflow IntegrationBasic HostingAdvanced CI/CDAdvanced CI/CDPurpose-Built Review ToolCustom DomainFreeFreeFreePaid Feature (Pro Plan)Recommended Path & Strategic AlternativesPrimary Recommendation: ChromaticBased on the comprehensive analysis, Chromatic is the recommended implementation path. It most effectively satisfies the mission's core objective of a near-zero maintenance solution that provides scalable access control for both private and public phases.The justification for this recommendation rests on three key pillars:Lowest Maintenance Governance Model: Chromatic's single greatest advantage is its automatic synchronization of permissions with the source Git repository.3 This is the purest implementation of the "near-zero maintenance" principle. There is no need to create or manage a separate list of users, invite stakeholders to a new platform, or configure complex authentication rules. Access is managed through the familiar and existing process of granting developers and stakeholders access to the GitHub repository. This eliminates a significant source of administrative overhead and potential for misconfiguration.Purpose-Built Workflow Integration: Chromatic is more than a hosting provider; it is a tool designed to improve the quality and efficiency of the design system development lifecycle.1 By choosing Chromatic, the project gains not only a display site but also a platform for automated visual testing, collaborative UI review, and component version history.57 These are features that a maturing design system will eventually require. Adopting Chromatic now provides a seamless path to enabling these capabilities in the future, whereas the other solutions would require integrating additional third-party tools to achieve the same functionality.Cost-Effective for Core Requirements: The snapshot-based pricing model is well-suited to the project's phased approach.62 The core requirement of hosting a private Storybook for review is available entirely within the generous free tier, as simple publishing does not consume snapshots. Costs are only incurred if and when the team decides to adopt the value-added features of automated visual testing and UI review. This "pay for value" model allows the project to start with a zero-cost solution that fully meets its immediate needs, while providing a clear and scalable path for adopting more advanced features later.While the lack of a free custom domain is a minor drawback, the fundamental benefits of its maintenance and governance model far outweigh this limitation, especially during the initial private preview phase where a branded URL is less critical.Fallback Option: VercelVercel is the recommended fallback option. It is the strongest alternative to Chromatic, primarily due to its "Vercel Authentication" feature, which is available on the free Hobby plan.7This feature provides a robust, secure, and no-cost method for implementing the required private previews. It allows the team to restrict access to deployments to specific Vercel users, which can be managed by inviting stakeholders to the Vercel team under the free "Viewer" role. This makes Vercel superior to both GitHub Pages (which cannot provide this feature) and Netlify (which charges for it).Decision Triggers for VercelThe project should pivot to Vercel as the primary choice under the following conditions:Absolute Zero-Cost Mandate for All Features: If the project has a strict requirement that all features, including a custom domain for the private preview, must be available at zero cost. Vercel offers free custom domains on its Hobby plan, whereas this is a premium feature on Chromatic.52Stakeholder Resistance to GitHub Access: If key stakeholders who must review the design system cannot or will not be granted even read-only access to the GitHub repository for policy or administrative reasons. In this scenario, managing access through a separate Vercel team would be a necessary alternative.The trade-offs of choosing Vercel are a slightly higher maintenance overhead due to the need to manage a user list in Vercel and maintain the vercel.json configuration file. The workflow is also less specialized for the design system review process compared to Chromatic.Implementation Notes for Mission B19.5The following notes provide a concrete, actionable plan for implementing the recommended Chromatic solution, intended to seed the follow-on build mission (B19.5).Step 1: GitHub Repository Secrets ConfigurationNavigate to the design system's GitHub repository.Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.Click "New repository secret".Create a secret with the name CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN. The value for this secret will be generated in the next step.Step 2: Chromatic Project SetupUsing a GitHub account that has admin access to the repository, sign in to chromatic.com.Follow the prompts to create a new project.Select the design system's GitHub repository to link it to the Chromatic project.During the setup process, Chromatic will provide a unique project-token. Copy this token.Return to the GitHub secret created in Step 1 and paste the copied token as its value.Step 3: CI Workflow ConfigurationIn the root of the repository, create the directory path .github/workflows/ if it does not already exist.Create a new file named chromatic.yml within this directory.Add the following content to the chromatic.yml file. This workflow will automatically publish the Storybook on every push to the main branch.56YAMLname: 'Publish Storybook to Chromatic'

        uses: chromaui/action@v1
        with:
          # Reference the secret created in Step 1
          projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          # The 'autoAcceptChanges' flag can be set to true for the main branch
          # to avoid manual approval for every visual change merged.
          autoAcceptChanges: 'main'
Step 4: Verification of package.json ScriptsEnsure that a script to build the static Storybook site exists in the package.json file. The Chromatic action can run this command directly, but it is best practice to have it defined.JSON"scripts": {
  "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
  "build-storybook": "storybook build"
}
Step 5: Governance and Stakeholder AccessIdentify all stakeholders who require access to the private Storybook preview.Confirm that each stakeholder has been granted at least "Read" access to the private GitHub repository.Once the first deployment is complete, share the Chromatic project link with the stakeholders. Their existing GitHub account access will be sufficient for them to view the deployed Storybook. No further invitations or platform-specific account creation is necessary.
