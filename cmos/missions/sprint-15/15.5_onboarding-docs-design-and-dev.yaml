displayName: "Implementation Mission"

missionId: "BI-20251019-155"

objective: >
  Ship two copy-paste quickstarts (Design + Dev) that work on a clean machine in ≤10 minutes,
  plus a local PR check script and a troubleshooting section based on a dry run.

context: |
  New contributors must be productive immediately. These docs codify the setup, the most common
  pitfalls, and a single command to run the local CI checks before opening a PR.

successCriteria:
  - "Design and Dev quickstarts each validated on a fresh clone in ≤10 minutes."
  - "Local PR script runs lint, types, unit, a11y, and VR-dry; exits non-zero on failure."
  - "Troubleshooting covers Chromatic auth, Storybook port conflicts, and Tokens export mismatch."
  - "Design quickstart shows a minimal Figma→Tokens export and creating a proof story."
  - "Dev quickstart shows running brand switcher and verifying per-brand baselines."

deliverables:
  - "/docs/getting-started/design.md and /docs/getting-started/dev.md"
  - "scripts/local-pr-check.mjs and docs link in top-level README."
  - "diagnostics.json.onboarding with timings and any fixes discovered."
