objective: >
  Resolve Storybook YELLOW by folding stray sections and aligning titles to the canonical taxonomy:
  Foundations, Components/{Primitives|Statusables|Data|Overlays}, Contexts, Domains, Patterns, Explorer, Brand.
  Remove top-level 'Proofs/*' and 'High Contrast' duplicates; keep HC proofs under Brand/High Contrast only.

context: |
  Assessor flagged missing canonical groups and stray top-level Proofs/Components/High Contrast. Stabilizing titles/paths
  improves navigation and reduces Chromatic grouping noise before S17 planning.

successCriteria:
  - "New tree matches canonical taxonomy exactly; no top-level Proofs or duplicate High Contrast groups."
  - "assessment.storybook.json → taxonomy.ok = true; extras: []"
  - "Chromatic dry-run shows no mass renames beyond intended folder folds."

deliverables:
  - "scripts/sb-taxonomy-fix.mjs (mass title rewrites + safe checks)"
  - ".storybook/TAXONOMY.md (authoritative tree + rules)"
  - "PR diff list of moved/retitled stories (for reviewer map)"

domainFields:

implementationNotes: |
  - Canonical mapping (examples):
      'Proofs/Components/Banner'     → 'Components/Statusables/Banner'
      'Proofs/High Contrast/*'       → 'Brand/High Contrast/*'
      'Components/Proofs/*'          → merge into respective Components/* or remove if dev-only
  - Guardrails:
      - Do NOT import CSS per-story; rely on global preview wiring.
      - For full-bleed: set `parameters.layout = 'fullscreen'` on the story (not globally).
  - Commands:
      - node scripts/sb-taxonomy-fix.mjs --dry
      - node scripts/sb-taxonomy-fix.mjs --apply
      - node scripts/state-assessment.mjs --sb
  - Acceptance:
      - Compare artifacts/state/storybook.json before/after; extras must be empty. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
