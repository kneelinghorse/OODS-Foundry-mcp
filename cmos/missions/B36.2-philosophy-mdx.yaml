title: Philosophy MDX Documentation
status: Queued
sprint: Sprint 36
created: 2025-12-03
tags: [documentation, mdx, philosophy, foundation]

objective: |
  Create the foundational philosophy documentation that explains WHY OODS exists
  and what makes it different from traditional component libraries.

context: |
  OODS's unique value is its object-centric, trait-based architecture.
  Currently this is invisible to users. These docs will be the first thing
  users see in Storybook navigation.

  Reference: cmos/reports/oods-navigation-implementation-plan.md (Part 4.1)

      Title: "Understanding OODS/Philosophy"

      CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:

      1. Opening Hook (2-3 paragraphs)
         - Problem: Component libraries don't scale for enterprise apps
         - Traditional approach: Build components, wire them together ad-hoc
         - OODS approach: Model your domain as Objects with Traits, render in Contexts

      2. The OODS Difference (with diagram)
         - Traditional: Component → Props → UI
         - OODS: Object → Traits → Context → UI
         - Show how a User object renders differently in List vs Detail vs Form

      3. Why This Matters
         - Consistency: Same object, same behavior, everywhere
         - Composability: Traits are reusable capabilities
         - Context-awareness: UI adapts to usage context automatically

      4. Key Concepts (brief intro, links to deeper docs)
         - Objects: Business entities (User, Invoice, Product)
         - Traits: Composable capabilities (Addressable, Stateful, Billable)
         - Contexts: Rendering situations (List, Detail, Form, Timeline)

      FORMAT: MDX with Storybook Canvas blocks where appropriate
      TONE: Conceptual, persuasive, not code-heavy
      LENGTH: ~800-1200 words

      Title: "Understanding OODS/Core Concepts"

      CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:

      1. Objects Section
         - Definition: Domain entities with identity and behavior
         - Examples: User, Organization, Product, Invoice, Subscription
         - Show object definition YAML snippet
         - Explain: Objects COMPOSE traits, they don't inherit

      2. Traits Section
         - Definition: Reusable capabilities that objects can have
         - Categories:
           * Core: Addressable, Authable, Classifiable, Communicable
           * Lifecycle: Stateful, Timestampable, Archivable, Cancellable
           * Domain: Billable, Payable, Refundable, Metered
         - Show trait definition YAML snippet
         - Explain: Traits bring schema, UI hints, validation, tokens

      3. Contexts Section
         - Definition: The rendering situation for an object
         - Canonical contexts: Detail, List, Form, Timeline
         - Compound contexts: Card, Inline, Chart, Dashboard
         - Show same User object in 4 different contexts (use images or Canvas)

      4. How They Connect
         - Diagram: Object + Traits → Compositor → Context → Rendered UI
         - The magic: Change context, UI adapts automatically

      FORMAT: MDX with code snippets and diagrams
      TONE: Educational, concrete examples
      LENGTH: ~1500-2000 words

success_criteria:
  - Both MDX files render correctly in Storybook
  - Files appear under "Understanding OODS" in navigation
  - Content explains OODS value proposition clearly
  - No broken links or missing images

validation:
  - command: pnpm storybook --smoke-test
    expected: Storybook starts without errors
  - manual: Navigate to Understanding OODS section
  - manual: Read through both docs, verify they make sense

dependencies:
  - B36.1  # Nav config must be in place first

notes: |
  These docs are the "front door" to OODS. They should make a user
  understand WHY OODS exists within 5 minutes of reading.

  Use placeholder diagrams if needed - we can enhance later.
  The important thing is the content structure and messaging.

  Reference existing docs:
  - docs/compositor-readme.md
  - docs/authoring-traits.md
  - docs/architecture/trait-engine-spec.md
