missionId: "BI-20251020-170"

objective: >
  Ensure Domains/Subscription and Domains/User stories inherit global decorators and token CSS,
  and remove dev-only 'RenderObject' entries from the sidebar.

context: |
  These domain stories appeared unstyled due to missing global decorators or mis-scoped meta.
  Fix story meta to rely on global preview wiring and eliminate dev-only artifacts from the menu.

successCriteria:
  - "All Subscription/User stories show correct styles across brand/theme (computed --cmp-* present)."
  - "'RenderObject' removed (or hidden) from sidebar; domain pages list only intended variants."
  - "No local CSS imports in these stories; globals provide styling."
  - "Axe smoke on a curated set: 0 violations."

deliverables:
  - "Updated meta: title paths under Domains/Subscription and Domains/User."
  - "Decorators array removed/cleaned where it shadowed globals; tags added as needed."
  - "artifacts/storybook/domains-wiring.json (lists files changed, decorators state, axe results)."

domainFields:
  type: "Build.Implementation.v1"
