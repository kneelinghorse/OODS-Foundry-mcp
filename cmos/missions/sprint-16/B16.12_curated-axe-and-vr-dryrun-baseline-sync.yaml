displayName: "Implementation Mission"

missionId: "BI-20251020-172"

objective: >
  Run a curated a11y smoke (axe) and Chromatic VR dry-run after wiring/taxonomy changes, confirm
  zero a11y violations and stable visuals, then checkpoint new baselines if intentional moves occurred.

context: |
  After wiring/taxonomy normalization, we need a quick confidence sweep. This does not approve visual
  changes unless intentional; it documents diffs and, if approved, syncs baselines.

successCriteria:
  - "Axe: 0 violations on curated set spanning Foundations/Components/Contexts/Domains/Brand/HC."
  - "VR dry-run produces only expected grouping/directory changes; component visuals unchanged."
  - "If intentional diffs exist, PR notes list them and baselines are accepted once reviewed."
  - "Diagnostics updated: per-brand VR green rate and axe summary."

deliverables:
  - "scripts/sb-verify.mjs (runs curated axe + VR dry)."
  - "artifacts/storybook/verify/axe.json and vr-summary.json (+ per-brand stats)."
  - "PR checklist note in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md for story changes."
  - "docs/storybook/verification.md (how to run/interpret)."

domainFields:
