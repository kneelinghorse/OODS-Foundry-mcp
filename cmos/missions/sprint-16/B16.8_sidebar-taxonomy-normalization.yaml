objective: >
  Reorganize Storybook sections to the canonical taxonomy; remove duplicates and dev-only examples
  without changing component code.

context: |
  A stable, minimal taxonomy reduces reviewer confusion and stabilizes visual baselines. This
  session updates story titles/paths only, and removes redundant sections.

successCriteria:
  - "Stories grouped exactly as: Foundations, Components/{Primitives|Statusables|Data|Overlays}, Contexts, Domains, Patterns, Explorer, Brand."
  - "Removed: #Example, #BrandA duplicates, unstyled Token Browser (fold into Foundations/Tokens Roundtrip)."
  - "No broken story imports; all stories compile and render post-move."
  - "README in /.storybook documents the taxonomy rules."

deliverables:
  - "Updated default exports `title: '...'` across stories to match taxonomy."
  - "Deleted/merged duplicate sections; PR diff lists all file path/title changes."
  - ".storybook/TAXONOMY.md with the authoritative tree."
