objective: >
  Deliver Progress (linear + circular) and Stepper components with canonical state models, multi-brand
  token hooks, and WCAG-compliant behavior informed by R18.1 research.

context: |
  Research R18.1 documents converged patterns for progress indicators and steppers across enterprise
  systems: determinate/indeterminate modes, step statuses (current, completed, incomplete, error,
  disabled, optional), and mandatory accessibility affordances (role="progressbar", ARIA attributes,
  keyboard focus). Sprint 18 needs production-ready components wired to Statusables tokens, Storybook
  proofs, and automated tests so downstream domains can adopt guided workflows without custom builds.

successCriteria:
  - "Linear and circular Progress components render determinate & indeterminate states; expose aria-valuenow/min/max when determinate."
  - "Stepper supports horizontal & vertical orientations, linear vs non-linear navigation, and emits step click events respecting isLinear guard."
  - "Storybook stories cover size variants, state transitions (indeterminate → determinate), and all step statuses with VR baselines refreshed."
  - "Tokens map to Statusables and view spacing per R18.1; lint/tests fail if literal colors are introduced."
  - "Automated axe/HC runs pass; unit tests cover state transitions and onStepClick contract."

deliverables:
  - "Components: src/components/progress/{ProgressLinear.tsx,ProgressCircular.tsx}, src/components/stepper/Stepper.tsx."
  - "Hooks/types: src/components/progress/types.ts, src/components/stepper/types.ts."
  - "Storybook: stories/components/Progress.stories.tsx, Stepper.stories.tsx with controls + docs."
  - "Tests: tests/components/progress.spec.tsx, stepper.spec.tsx (render + interaction + a11y)."
  - "Token additions (if required) + documentation snippet under docs/components/progression.md."
