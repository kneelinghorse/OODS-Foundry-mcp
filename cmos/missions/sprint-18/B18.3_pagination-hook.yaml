objective: >
  Build a headless usePagination hook and presentational Pagination component supporting truncation,
  mobile collapse, and WCAG-compliant semantics.

context: |
  Research highlights the need for a reusable pagination logic layer (Material UI's usePagination) and
  responsive truncation (ellipsis, sibling/boundary counts). The component must expose aria-current,
  handle mobile collapse, and integrate with tokens for interactive states. This mission delivers both
  the hook and UI component plus Storybook proofs for multiple data scenarios.

successCriteria:
  - "usePagination hook returns structured items (page, next, previous, ellipsis) with configurable sibling/boundary counts."
  - "Pagination component consumes hook output, renders buttons/links with aria-current, disabled states for boundaries, mobile collapse pattern."
  - "Storybook stories cover small & large page counts, double ellipsis, mobile layout, and integration demo with data table."
  - "Unit tests validate hook logic (edge cases, invalid inputs) + component interactions; axe/HC run passes."
  - "Tokens applied via theme (selected background/text, hover) and no literal colors introduced."

deliverables:
  - "Hook: src/hooks/usePagination.ts."
  - "Component: src/components/pagination/Pagination.tsx."
  - "Storybook: stories/components/Pagination.stories.tsx."
  - "Tests: tests/components/pagination.spec.ts (hook + component)."
  - "Doc snippet in docs/components/navigation.md (pagination section)."
