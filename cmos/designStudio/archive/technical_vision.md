# AI-Driven Design Orchestration Layer Technical Vision

## Executive Summary
An intelligent design orchestration system that integrates Mission Protocol MCP server with OODS-Foundry design patterns to enable research-to-design workflows. Focused on AI-driven design creation using pattern knowledge for Figma and design system output, rather than code generation.

## Core Integration Architecture

### Mission Protocol MCP Server Integration
- **Design Mission Templates**: Extend Mission Protocol with design-focused mission types
- **Research-to-Design Workflow**: Connect research findings to design pattern selection
- **Constraint Validation**: Design system compliance checking within mission execution
- **Orchestration Layer**: AI agent coordination for design workflow management

### OODS-Foundry Pattern Integration
- **Trait-Based Design Patterns**: Leverage OODS-Foundry's human-centered, trait-based system
- **Pattern Knowledge Base**: Semantic mapping of design patterns to domain requirements
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Design system rules and compliance validation
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintain design system integrity across generated artifacts

## Research-to-Design Workflow

### Phase 1: Deep Research & Modeling
- **Domain Analysis**: Research specific application domains (banking, healthcare, etc.)
- **Pattern Identification**: Map research findings to OODS-Foundry design patterns
- **Model Creation**: Build domain-specific design models and requirements

### Phase 2: Mission Protocol Orchestration
- **Design Brief Creation**: Convert research models into Mission Protocol design briefs
- **Pattern Selection**: AI-driven pattern recommendation based on domain context
- **Constraint Application**: Apply design system rules and constraints

### Phase 3: AI-Driven Design Generation
- **Multi-Modal Input**: Research findings, visual references, design requirements
- **Pattern Composition**: Intelligent composition of OODS-Foundry patterns
- **Figma Output**: Generation of Figma-compatible design artifacts
- **Design System Sync**: Ensure compatibility with existing design systems
