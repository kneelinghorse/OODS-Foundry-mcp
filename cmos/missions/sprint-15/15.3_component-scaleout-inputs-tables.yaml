displayName: "Implementation Mission"

missionId: "BI-20251019-153"

objective: >
  Implement core form inputs (TextField, Select, Checkbox) and a basic data Table with
  standardized field contracts, validation wiring, focus/HC resilience, and brand/theme parity.

context: |
  Inputs and tables are representative surfaces that harden label/description/validation patterns,
  focus visibility in HC, and density via spacing tokens. They reuse the centralized status mapping.

successCriteria:
  - "All inputs expose: id, label, description, validation { state, message, id }."
  - "aria-describedby correctly associates descriptions + validation messages."
  - "Focus ring visible in HC; no literal colors used for states."
  - "Table supports keyboard nav, row selection via aria-selected and visible focus."
  - "Axe checks pass for curated stories; VR matrices cover compact/comfortable densities."
  - "Unit tests cover validation ARIA wiring; Playwright tabs through form and verifies SR text."

deliverables:
  - "TextField, Select, Checkbox; Table (Row/Cell/Header); stories for densities and status-in-cell."
  - "Shared validation utils and status mapping reuse."
  - "Unit + Playwright tests; docs: /docs/components/forms.md and /docs/components/table.md."
