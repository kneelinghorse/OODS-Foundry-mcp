tags: [documentation, accessibility, mdx, navigation-phase-4]

objective: |
  Create an MDX documentation page explaining OODS's accessibility philosophy
  and implementation approach.

  This completes the "Understanding OODS" documentation section by adding
  the accessibility perspective alongside Philosophy, Core Concepts, Trait Engine,
  Getting Started, and Visualization System.

  EXISTING A11Y CONTENT TO REFERENCE:

  - docs/viz/accessibility-checklist.md — Viz-specific checklist
  - stories/docs/Accessibility.ContractA11y.mdx — Contract details
  - stories/proofs/view-profiles/ForcedColors.stories.tsx — High contrast
  - Trait definitions include accessibility metadata (keyboard, screenreader)

  PHILOSOPHY ALIGNMENT:

  OODS treats accessibility as a FIRST-CLASS CONCERN, not an afterthought:
  - Traits declare a11y requirements in metadata
  - statusRegistry includes semantic announcements
  - High contrast / forced-colors supported throughout
  - Keyboard navigation built into components

      STORY TITLE: "Understanding OODS/Accessibility Approach"

      STRUCTURE:

      ```mdx
      import { Meta } from '@storybook/blocks';

      <Meta title="Understanding OODS/Accessibility Approach" />

      # Accessibility Approach

      **How OODS Makes Accessibility a First-Class Concern**

      ---

      ## Philosophy

      [2-3 paragraphs on OODS accessibility philosophy]
      - Accessibility is designed in, not bolted on
      - Traits declare their a11y requirements
      - Components inherit accessible behavior by default
      - statusRegistry provides semantic announcements

      ---

      ## The Three Pillars

      ### 1. Perceivable
      - Color contrast (WCAG 2.2 AA baseline)
      - High contrast / forced-colors support
      - Status announcements for screen readers
      - Visual indicators beyond color alone

      ### 2. Operable
      - Full keyboard navigation
      - Focus management in composed views
      - No keyboard traps
      - Sufficient time for interactions

      ### 3. Understandable
      - Consistent patterns across objects
      - Predictable state changes
      - Clear error messages
      - Status context in announcements

      ---

      ## Accessibility in Traits

      [Explain how traits declare a11y requirements]

      Each trait definition includes accessibility metadata:

      ```yaml
      metadata:
        accessibility:
          keyboard: "Supports tab navigation"
          screenreader: "Announces status changes"
      ```

      The trait engine propagates these requirements to composed objects.

      ---

      ## High Contrast Support

      [Brief explanation of forced-colors mode]
      - System-level high contrast detection
      - Token cascade adapts automatically
      - Link to: Accessibility/High Contrast story

      ---

      ## Status Announcements

      [Explain statusRegistry's a11y features]
      - Status changes trigger ARIA live regions
      - Tone mapping includes announcement text
      - Link to: statusRegistry in Trait Engine docs

      ---

      ## Testing & Compliance

      [Brief mention of testing approach]
      - axe-core integration
      - Contrast validation in CI
      - Manual testing checklist
      - Link to: docs/viz/accessibility-checklist.md

      ---

      ## Resources

      Links to detailed documentation:
      - High Contrast: stories/proofs/view-profiles/ForcedColors
      - Viz Accessibility: docs/viz/accessibility-checklist.md
      - Contract Details: stories/docs/Accessibility.ContractA11y.mdx
      ```

      KEY PRINCIPLE: This page is a PHILOSOPHY and NAVIGATION HUB.
      It explains WHY accessibility matters in OODS and WHERE to find details.
      Don't duplicate the detailed docs.

      WORD COUNT TARGET: ~600 words (brief, scannable)

  - Three pillars (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable) clearly explained
  - Links to detailed a11y documentation work
  - Consistent styling with other Understanding OODS pages
  - No duplication of existing detailed docs

validation:
  - command: pnpm storybook --smoke-test
    expected: MDX page loads without errors
  - manual: Navigate to Understanding OODS/Accessibility Approach
  - manual: Verify links work
  - manual: Compare styling with other Understanding OODS pages

notes: |
  SUMMARIZE, DON'T DUPLICATE.

  Detailed accessibility documentation already exists:
  - Accessibility.ContractA11y.mdx
  - docs/viz/accessibility-checklist.md
  - High contrast proofs

  This page provides the "front door" — explaining the philosophy and
  pointing to detailed resources. It should NOT replicate the checklists
  or detailed implementation guides.

  OODS DIFFERENTIATOR:
  The key message is that accessibility is DESIGNED INTO the trait system,
  not added as a separate concern. Traits declare a11y requirements, and
  the engine propagates them. This is different from most design systems.
