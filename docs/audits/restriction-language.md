# Restriction Language Audit (Top-Level Docs)

Date: 2025-12-19
Scope: root-level docs plus docs/README.md, docs/getting_started.md, docs/summary.md, and agents.md.

Findings to revisit in later missions:

- docs/getting_started.md:453 - "Runtime components cannot opt out."
- docs/summary.md:5 - "required GitHub jobs" and "merge gating expectations."
- docs/README.md:51,197 - "Components consume only / use only --cmp-* tokens."
- agents.md - restriction-heavy framing; slated for B41.4 rewrite.

Notes:

- README.md updated in B41.1 to remove restriction-focused phrasing and clarify repo identity.
