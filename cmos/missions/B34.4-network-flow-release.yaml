        Full integration test suite:
        - All components render
        - All adapters produce valid output
        - Cross-filter works end-to-end
        - CLI commands work
        - Example dashboards load

        Performance benchmarks:
        - Treemap render time (500 nodes < 200ms)
        - Sunburst render time (300 nodes < 200ms)
        - Force Graph render time (100 nodes < 500ms)
        - Sankey render time (50 nodes < 100ms)
        - Memory usage within limits
        - No memory leaks on re-render

        Update changelog with v1.0 release:

        ```markdown
        ## [X.X.X] - YYYY-MM-DD

        ### Added

        #### Network & Flow Module v1.0

        New visualization types for hierarchical, network, and flow data:

        - **Treemap**: Hierarchical rectangles with drill-down
        - **Sunburst**: Radial hierarchy with ancestor highlighting
        - **Force Graph**: Force-directed network layout
        - **Sankey**: Flow diagram with gradient links

        Key features:
        - Native ECharts rendering for optimal performance
        - Cross-filter integration for dashboards
        - CLI scaffolding support
        - Comprehensive accessibility fallbacks

        **Note:** v1.0 requires ECharts. Vega-Lite support planned for v1.1+.
        See docs/viz/network-flow/v1-constraints.md for details.

        New components:
        - `<Treemap>`
        - `<Sunburst>`
        - `<ForceGraph>`
        - `<Sankey>`

        New traits:
        - `Hierarchical`
        - `NetworkTopology`
        - `FlowConservation`
        - `CrossFilterableNetwork`
        ```

        - [ ] Package published to registry
        - [ ] Release tag created
        - [ ] Announcement posted

technicalApproach:
  - Run full test suite
  - Run performance benchmarks
  - Fix any issues found
  - Write release notes
  - Update changelog
  - Prepare deployment
  - Execute deployment
  - Post announcement

qualityGates:
  during_development:
    - All tests pass locally
    - Performance benchmarks pass

  before_completion:
    - CI passes
    - Performance benchmarks pass
    - Documentation complete
    - Release notes reviewed
    - Team sign-off obtained

estimatedEffort: "0.5 session (30-40k tokens)"

notes: |
  Release checklist priorities:
  1. Tests pass
  2. Performance acceptable
  3. Documentation complete
  4. Clear communication of v1.0 constraints

  Announcement should:
  - Highlight new capabilities
  - Be clear about ECharts requirement
  - Set expectations for v1.1+
  - Link to documentation

  Performance targets based on R33.0 findings:
  - ECharts handles these sizes well
  - Larger datasets may need progressive rendering
