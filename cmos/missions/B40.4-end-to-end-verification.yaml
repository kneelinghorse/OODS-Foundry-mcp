      MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS

      1. Start Storybook: pnpm storybook
      2. Navigate through each top-level section
      3. Verify stories load without errors
      4. Check for console warnings
      5. Verify interactive elements work
      6. Test dark mode toggle
      7. Test brand switcher (if applicable)
      8. Check mobile/responsive behavior

      Record any issues in the verification report.

      A11Y SPOT CHECK

      Run axe on key stories:
      ```bash
      pnpm a11y:check
      ```

      Spot check keyboard navigation on:
      - Object Explorer
      - Trait story interactive elements
      - Form components

success_criteria:
  - Verification report created with all checkboxes
  - No critical issues blocking release
  - All major sections have content
  - Interactive elements functional
  - A11y spot check passes

validation:
  - command: pnpm build-storybook
    expected: Build succeeds without errors
  - command: pnpm a11y:check 2>&1 | tail -5
    expected: No critical violations
  - file: cmos/reports/e2e-verification-sprint40.md
    expected: File exists with completed checklist

dependencies:
  - B40.3  # Cleanup should be done first

notes: |
  This is a verification/documentation mission, not a fix-it mission.

  If issues are found:
  - Minor issues: Fix during this mission
  - Major issues: Document and create Sprint 41 mission

  The verification report becomes part of the release documentation
  and can be referenced in release notes.

  Time estimate: 1-2 hours of manual verification + documentation
