id: B41.7
sprint_id: Sprint 41
name: Navigation Final Polish
status: Queued

objective: |
  Complete the Storybook navigation cleanup by moving Dashboard to Contexts,
  deleting ECharts duplicates, and fixing Traits nesting consistency.

context: |
  After B41.6 we have 10 top-level sections as planned, but three issues remain:

  1. Dashboard and Context Gallery are buried in Proofs & Internals/Contexts/
     instead of being in the main Contexts section

  2. Visualization has an ECharts/ subfolder with duplicates of the main viz
     components (Graph, Sankey, Sunburst, Treemap)

  3. Traits have inconsistent nesting - some are under Core/ or Domain/ while
     9 traits sit at the root level instead of being properly categorized

success_criteria:
  - Dashboard appears under Contexts/Compound/Dashboard
  - Full Context Gallery appears under Contexts/Overview
  - No stories under Visualization/ECharts/
  - All Traits nested under Core/, Lifecycle/, or Domain/ per the plan

deliverables:
  - 2 story title updates for Contexts
  - 4 ECharts story files deleted
  - 9 Trait story title updates
