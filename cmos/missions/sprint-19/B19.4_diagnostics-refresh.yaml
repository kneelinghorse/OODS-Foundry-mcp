missionId: "BI-20251101-194"

objective: >
  Refresh diagnostics/performance baselines and documentation, aligning state assessment outputs and
  runbooks for the upcoming private review.

context: |
  Performance harness work (B18.7/B18.8) introduces new metrics. Before private review we need updated
  dashboards, docs, and state assessment artifacts that reflect current baselines with clear budgets and
  remediation guidance.

successCriteria:
  - "Diagnostics dashboards (artifacts/state/*.json, docs/diagnostics.md) updated with latest baselines."
  - "Perf harness budgets recorded (compositor ≤7ms, list demo ≤150ms, token transform ≤3s) with evidence."
  - "State assessment script defaults include new metrics and README instructions."
  - "Runbooks highlight how to rerun perf/a11y/VR checks before review."
  - "Guardrail outputs (artifacts/state/guardrails.json, diagnostics.helpers.guardrails, diagnostics.tokens.governance) captured and referenced for reviewer readiness."
  - "Summary logged in docs/changelog/sprint-19.md."

deliverables:
  - "Updated diagnostics.json and artifacts/state/* outputs."
  - "docs/diagnostics/README.md refresh with budgets + troubleshooting."
  - "Scripts/state-assessment.mjs adjustments (if needed) + README updates covering guardrail/tokens snapshots."
  - "Changelog note capturing baseline refresh."

domainFields:
  type: "Build.Implementation.v1"

  dependencies:
    - "Requires B18.7 Performance harness core."
    - "Requires B18.8 Performance CI integration."

  implementationScope:
    coreDeliverable: "Accurate diagnostics and perf baselines ready for reviewers."
    outOfScope:
      - "New perf features; only baselining/documentation."
      - "Tooling beyond diagnostics/state assessment."

  handoffContext:
    completed:
      - "Diagnostics doc + state artifacts committed."
      - "Runbook instructions validated (followed once)."
      - "Known gaps logged if budgets unmet."
    interfaces:
      - "scripts/state-assessment.mjs, diagnostics.json, docs/diagnostics/*."
    assumptions:
      - "Perf harness instrumentation available from Sprint 18."
