objective: >
  Investigate enterprise-grade progression and navigation components (Progress/Stepper, Tabs, Pagination,
  Breadcrumbs, Empty-state kits, Toast queues) to define canonical UX patterns, token hooks, and
  accessibility requirements for Sprint 18 build work.

context: |
  Sprint 18 plans to ship Component Set IV and a final QA wave. Before sizing those build missions we
  need detailed evidence on cross-brand, multi-domain component behavior: states, transitions, token
  mappings (light/dark/HC), VR/a11y requirements, and guardrails for overlays/usage contexts. This
  research builds on prior multi-brand/theming and HC studies (r09.1, r4.x) and extends them to the
  remaining navigation/progression primitives.

successCriteria:
  - "All research questions answered with cited sources and examples."
  - "Key findings categorize canonical patterns and token/a11y implications."
  - "Build implications translate into actionable component requirements and Storybook proof guidance."
  - "Contradictions or gaps documented with recommendations for follow-up spikes if needed."

deliverables:
  - "This completed research brief with evidence references."
  - "buildImplications section ready to seed Sprint 18 component missions."

domainFields:
  type: "Build.TechnicalResearch.v1"

  researchQuestions:
    - "What canonical states and transitions exist for Progress/Stepper components in multi-brand enterprise systems?"
    - "How do Tabs, Pagination, and Breadcrumbs handle density, responsive behavior, and high-contrast theming across brands?"
    - "What token hooks (spacing, typography, color, motion) are required to keep Empty-states and Toast queues aligned with Statusables/Usage tokens?"
    - "What accessibility heuristics (focus order, ARIA attributes, keyboard support) are considered non-negotiable for these components?"
    - "How do leading design systems instrument VR/a11y testing coverage for these navigation components?"
