A Curated Universe of Modern Web Platforms for Data Model Analysis
Section 1: Introduction to the Curated Digital Canon
1.1. Mission Objective and Rationale
This report documents the methodology and presents the results of a comprehensive curation initiative to establish a representative dataset of approximately 5,000 modern, canonical business and information websites. The primary objective of this mission is to construct a foundational corpus for a large-scale research project aimed at mapping the convergence and divergence of data models across the contemporary software landscape. The resulting "site universe" is intended to serve as a high-fidelity, structured input for subsequent automated and manual schema analysis.

The rationale for this undertaking is predicated on the understanding that the structural underpinnings of modern software—its data models, schemas, and APIs—are evolving at an unprecedented rate. A systematic analysis of these structures can reveal significant trends in software architecture, business process automation, and inter-platform interoperability. However, the validity of such an analysis is fundamentally dependent on the quality, representativeness, and methodological rigor of the initial dataset. This report details the construction of such a dataset, designed to be a robust and defensible snapshot of the current digital ecosystem.

1.2. Scope and Strategic Boundaries
The scope of this curation effort was governed by a set of strategic boundaries designed to ensure the final dataset is both relevant and analytically tractable. The following constraints were applied throughout the sourcing, filtering, and validation phases:

Language and Accessibility: The curation focuses exclusively on English-language sites or global services that are fully available and documented in English. This ensures consistency for subsequent natural language processing and manual review of documentation.

Schema and API Prioritization: A primary constraint was the prioritization of platforms with publicly accessible schemas, whether through structured data markup (e.g., schema.org), documented REST or GraphQL APIs, or other forms of developer-facing data model documentation. This criterion is essential, as the ultimate research goal is the analysis of these very structures.   

Exclusion of Obfuscated Systems: Conversely, sites that actively hide, obscure, or provide no public information regarding their underlying data structures were systematically excluded. This ensures that the dataset is composed of entities that, to some degree, embrace platform-centric and interoperable design principles.

Modernity and Activity: The dataset is limited to platforms that are actively developed and maintained. The operational definition of "active" was a verifiable update or maintenance activity within the last 12 months. This constraint filters out dormant or abandoned projects, ensuring the dataset reflects contemporary, not historical, software practices.

Exclusion of Non-Canonical Entities: The curation explicitly excludes outdated personal blogs, legacy local service websites (defined as over 15 years old with no significant recent modernization), and non-professional platforms. This focuses the dataset on entities that represent significant business, information, or software systems.   

1.3. Structure of the Report
This report is structured to provide a transparent and exhaustive account of the curation process and its output. Section 2 details the multi-vector sourcing framework used to gather a diverse and representative initial list of candidate sites. Section 3 defines the formal classification taxonomy and data domain schema applied to each entity. Section 4 outlines the multi-stage filtering and validation protocol used to refine the candidate list according to the mission's constraints. Section 5 presents a compositional analysis of the final curated universe, highlighting key statistical distributions and thematic observations. Section 6 contains the master list of curated websites, the primary deliverable of this mission. Finally, Section 7 offers concluding remarks on the dataset's utility and proposes potential avenues for the subsequent schema analysis phase.

Section 2: Multi-Vector Curation Framework and Source Triangulation
A foundational principle of this curation effort is that no single source can provide a sufficiently representative sample of the modern digital landscape. Any individual list—whether based on revenue, web traffic, or market capitalization—carries inherent biases. To mitigate this, a multi-vector sourcing framework was developed to triangulate data from disparate, high-quality sources. This framework is designed to construct a balanced portfolio of digital entities, capturing distinct "strata" of the digital economy: established incumbents, high-growth disruptors, attention-dominating platforms, and influential sector specialists.

2.1. Vector 1: The Incumbent Stratum (Established Public Enterprises)
This vector targets large, publicly traded corporations that represent scaled, mature, and often complex software systems. These entities form the bedrock of the global economy, and their digital platforms are critical for understanding enterprise-grade data models.

The primary sources for this stratum were the 2024 Fortune 500 lists and other rankings of the largest public companies by revenue and market capitalization. Approximately 1,000 entities were selected from the top tiers of these lists, ensuring comprehensive coverage across foundational industries. This includes retail giants like Walmart (ranked #1 on the Fortune 500), technology conglomerates like Apple and Microsoft, healthcare leaders such as UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health, and financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway. The primary corporate domains for these entities (e.g., walmart.com, apple.com, microsoft.com) were identified as the canonical entries for this vector.   

A crucial aspect of this vector is the inclusion of companies not traditionally defined as "technology" firms but which have developed massive, modern digital footprints as part of their business operations. Companies like Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Boeing represent the digital transformation of industrial-era data models. Their public-facing websites and, more importantly, their increasingly sophisticated APIs for customers, developers, and partners, represent the digitization of complex, physical-world data domains such as supply chain logistics, vehicle telemetry, manufacturing processes, and financial services. For example, Walmart's extensive API services enable affiliates, sellers, and supply chain partners to integrate directly with its vast inventory and fulfillment systems, exposing a data model that bridges digital e-commerce with physical logistics. The inclusion of these "digitizing incumbents" is therefore vital for establishing a baseline of how complex, legacy data models are being represented and evolved within modern software architectures, providing a critical point of comparison against digital-native companies.   

2.2. Vector 2: The Disruptor Stratum (High-Growth & Venture-Backed Innovators)
This vector focuses on privately held, high-growth companies that are often at the vanguard of architectural innovation and new market creation. These "unicorns"—private companies valued at over $1 billion—are frequently API-first and represent the leading edge of data model design in high-growth sectors.

The primary source for this stratum was the Crunchbase Unicorn List, a comprehensive database of high-value, venture-backed companies, supplemented by data from other startup directories. Approximately 1,500 companies were curated from these sources, with a strong emphasis on influential players in key modern sectors. This includes foundational companies in AI (OpenAI, Anthropic), fintech (Stripe, Revolut), and enterprise SaaS (Databricks, Rippling). Data points such as post-money valuation and total equity funding serve as strong proxies for market influence, technological sophistication, and the perceived value of their underlying platforms and data models.   

Analysis of these sources reveals a significant concentration of high-value companies in specific domains. The intense clustering of investment in sectors like Financial Technology (e.g., Stripe, Ramp, Revolut, Chime) and Enterprise SaaS (e.g., Databricks, Miro, Deel, Canva) indicates that these fields are contemporary epicenters of data model innovation. High levels of venture capital investment are a direct signal of perceived market opportunity and technological advantage. The non-uniform distribution of this capital suggests that the most novel, competitive, and potentially convergent data models are being aggressively developed and refined within these specific clusters. Consequently, the curation methodology deliberately over-samples from these high-growth sectors to ensure the final dataset captures the most contemporary and influential data architectures that are defining the next generation of software.   

2.3. Vector 3: The Attention Stratum (High-Traffic Digital Platforms)
This vector ensures the inclusion of platforms that dominate global user attention and define the paradigms for mass-market data interaction. While there can be overlap with the other vectors (e.g., Amazon is both a Fortune 500 company and a high-traffic site), this vector's primary purpose is to capture entities whose influence is defined by their vast user base and daily engagement.

The primary sources were global website traffic rankings from established analytics firms, including Semrush, Backlinko, and Exploding Topics. The top 500 unique, non-redundant, and relevant domains from these lists were incorporated. This process captures foundational internet services like search engines (google.com, bing.com), social media platforms (facebook.com, instagram.com, x.com), content and media hubs (youtube.com, wikipedia.org, netflix.com), and major global e-commerce destinations (amazon.com, ebay.com).   

A key observation from this stratum is the distinction between simple "product" or "content" websites and complex, multi-sided "platforms." A high-traffic media site like nytimes.com has a relatively straightforward core data model centered on articles, authors, and subscribers. In contrast, a platform like amazon.com possesses a vastly more intricate model that must manage a multitude of interacting entities: products, third-party sellers, individual buyers, reviews, warehouses, logistical shipments, streaming video content, and cloud computing services. The traffic rankings are dominated by these platform entities, which function as digital marketplaces or ecosystems. This demonstrates that a significant portion of modern data modeling is not concerned with a simple business-to-customer relationship, but rather with orchestrating complex, multi-tenant, multi-actor systems. The curation process, therefore, explicitly tags these "platform" or "marketplace" models, as they represent a distinct and dominant architectural pattern in the contemporary digital landscape.   

2.4. Vector 4: The Specialist Stratum (Sector-Specific Canons)
To ensure sufficient depth and representation in critical modern industries, this final vector involves targeted sourcing from specialized industry reports and directories. This approach supplements the broader lists with canonical examples that may not be Fortune 500 giants or top-100 traffic sites but are highly influential and architecturally significant within their respective niches. Approximately 2,000 additional sites were sourced through this vector.

The sources and representative inclusions for this stratum include:

SaaS/Enterprise Software: Lists from industry publications and review aggregators like Datamation, G2, and Capterra were used to identify key B2B and B2C software platforms. This ensures the inclusion of ubiquitous workplace tools such as Salesforce, Atlassian (Jira, Confluence), Adobe, Asana, and Slack.   

E-commerce: Market capitalization and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) rankings were used to add globally significant e-commerce platforms beyond the top-traffic list. This brought in major international players like Shopify (Canada), MercadoLibre (Argentina), and Coupang (USA/South Korea).   

Fintech: Dedicated fintech industry reports were leveraged to identify leaders in digital payments, banking, and investment. This confirmed the inclusion of foundational platforms like PayPal, Block (formerly Square), Adyen, and Plaid.   

Media: Rankings of the largest global media companies by revenue were used to incorporate major content producers and distributors. This added entities such as Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, and Spotify.   

Health-Tech: Lists of top health technology companies from publications like TIME and Newsweek were used to capture innovators in this rapidly growing sector. This ensured the inclusion of companies focused on AI-driven diagnostics, data analytics, and patient management, such as Tempus, Komodo Health, and SOPHiA GENETICS.   

Analysis of these specialist sources, particularly within the SaaS category, reveals a powerful trend toward verticalization. While early SaaS platforms were often horizontal, designed to serve a function (e.g., CRM) across any industry, many modern platforms are built for a single, specific industry. Examples include PerformLine for marketing compliance, GlossGenius for beauty and wellness professionals, and Motive for fleet management. This pattern of specialization suggests a major branch of data model evolution, where architectures are deeply tailored to the unique entities, workflows, and regulatory requirements of a specific vertical. The curation methodology, therefore, actively sought out and classified these "Vertical SaaS" platforms, as they represent a crucial and expanding segment of the modern software landscape that would be underrepresented by relying solely on general-purpose lists.

Section 3: Classification Taxonomy and Data Domain Schema
To render the curated list of websites analytically useful, a formal classification taxonomy was developed and applied to each entry. This schema consists of two primary axes: the platform's main industry or type, and its primary data domain or business model. This dual-axis classification allows for precise filtering and comparative analysis, enabling researchers to isolate and study specific cohorts of digital platforms.

3.1. Primary Industry/Platform Type Classification
This classification identifies the primary sector or architectural model of the website. The following categories were defined and used for classification:

SaaS (Software as a Service): Denotes platforms that provide cloud-based software, typically licensed on a subscription basis. This is a broad category encompassing many modern business tools, such as salesforce.com (CRM), miro.com (collaboration), and grammarly.com (writing assistance). This category is further sub-classified as Horizontal SaaS (serving a function across industries) or Vertical SaaS (serving a specific industry).   

E-commerce: Refers to sites primarily engaged in the direct-to-consumer online retail of physical or digital goods. Examples include brand-specific stores like nike.com and specialized retailers like chewy.com.   

Marketplace: Describes platforms whose core function is to connect third-party buyers and sellers, facilitating transactions between them. This is distinct from E-commerce, where the platform owner is the primary seller. Canonical examples include amazon.com, ebay.com, and etsy.com.   

Enterprise Software: A category for large-scale software systems, often with on-premise or hybrid deployment models, designed for core corporate operations. This includes vendors of ERP, database, and other foundational business systems like oracle.com and sap.com.   

Fintech: Encompasses all technology platforms designed for the financial services industry, including payment processing, digital banking, lending, and investment. Key examples are stripe.com, paypal.com, and revolut.com.   

Media & Content Platform: Platforms whose primary purpose is the creation, aggregation, and distribution of digital content, including news, video, audio, and user-generated content. This category includes netflix.com, spotify.com, and nytimes.com.   

Health-Tech: Designates technology platforms focused on the healthcare industry. This includes services for electronic health records, medical data analytics, patient management, and diagnostics. Examples include tempus.com and iodinesoftware.com.   

Infrastructure & Developer Tools (IaaS/PaaS): Refers to foundational services and platforms used by developers to build, deploy, and manage other software applications. This includes cloud providers like aws.amazon.com, data platforms like databricks.com, and code repositories like github.com.   

Social & Communication: Platforms designed primarily for user-to-user interaction, networking, and communication. This includes social networks like facebook.com and linkedin.com, as well as communication tools like discord.com.   

3.2. Primary Data Domain Tagging
This classification describes the primary business model and the nature of the data flow between the platform and its users. The following tags were applied:

B2B (Business-to-Business): The platform's primary customers are other businesses. The data model is oriented around organizational accounts, user roles, and business-centric workflows. Examples include splunk.com (data analytics for enterprises) and adp.com (HR and payroll services).   

B2C (Business-to-Consumer): The platform's primary customers are individual consumers. The data model is centered on individual user accounts, personal preferences, and direct-to-consumer transactions. Examples include disneyplus.com (streaming service) and duolingo.com (language learning app).   

B2B2C (Business-to-Business-to-Consumer): The platform provides services to businesses, which in turn use those services to serve their own end consumers. The data model must often handle a complex, multi-tenant architecture. The canonical example is shopify.com, which provides an e-commerce platform for businesses to build their own B2C storefronts.   

Marketplace/Platform: The platform facilitates transactions or interactions between two or more distinct user groups (e.g., riders and drivers; hosts and guests). The data model is inherently relational, managing the profiles, interactions, and transactions between these groups.

Content Platform: The primary data model revolves around the creation, aggregation, and delivery of content. Core entities include content items (videos, articles), creators, and consumers. Examples include youtube.com and theguardian.com.   

Government/Public Sector: The platform provides services offered by or for government entities. An example is the United States Postal Service website, usps.com.   

To ensure consistent application of this taxonomy, a reference table of canonical examples was utilized throughout the curation process.

Domain Name	Company Name	Primary Industry	Data Domain	Justification
salesforce.com	Salesforce, Inc.	SaaS	B2B	Provides cloud-based CRM software to businesses.
nike.com	Nike, Inc.	E-commerce	B2C	Sells apparel and footwear directly to consumers.
etsy.com	Etsy, Inc.	Marketplace	Marketplace	Connects independent sellers of handmade/vintage goods with buyers.
shopify.com	Shopify Inc.	E-commerce / SaaS	B2B2C	Provides a platform for businesses to create their own B2C storefronts.
stripe.com	Stripe, Inc.	Fintech	B2B	Offers payment processing infrastructure for online businesses.
netflix.com	Netflix, Inc.	Media & Content Platform	B2C	Provides a subscription-based video streaming service to consumers.
github.com	GitHub, Inc.	Infrastructure & Developer Tools	B2B / Platform	Hosts code repositories for developers and provides collaboration tools for teams.
Section 4: Multi-Stage Filtering and Validation Protocol
Following the initial sourcing from the four vectors, a multi-stage filtering and validation protocol was executed to refine the gross list of several thousand candidates into the final, high-fidelity dataset. This process systematically applied the mission's constraints, ensuring each entry in the final list meets the required criteria for modernity, relevance, and analytical utility.

4.1. De-duplication and Canonical Domain Resolution
The first stage involved a rigorous de-duplication and normalization process. As data was aggregated from multiple sources, redundancies were common. This process addressed several types of duplication:

URL Variations: Different sources might list variations of a domain (e.g., http://www.example.com, https://example.com). All URLs were normalized to a standard canonical form (example.com).

Brand Redirects: In cases of rebranding or acquisition, multiple domains might point to the same entity. For example, traffic data for both twitter.com and x.com were identified and resolved to the single canonical domain x.com.   

Corporate vs. Product Domains: A distinction was made between a parent corporation's informational site (e.g., alphabet.com) and its primary product or service domain (e.g., google.com). In all such cases, the primary service/product domain was selected for inclusion, as its underlying data model is of greater interest to this research than that of a corporate investor relations site.   

4.2. Activity Verification Protocol
To satisfy the constraint that all included sites must be actively maintained within the last 12 months, a cascading verification protocol was applied to each candidate:

Automated Web Scraping: An initial automated pass was conducted to scan the footer of each site's homepage for a copyright notice. The presence of the current or previous calendar year was used as a strong positive signal of recent activity.

Content Freshness Check: For sites passing the initial check or where a date was ambiguous, a secondary check looked for timestamps on recent news articles, blog posts, or press releases. A publication date within the last 12 months was considered sufficient evidence of activity.

Developer Activity Check: For platforms primarily targeting a developer audience (e.g., SaaS, Infrastructure), a tertiary check was performed. This involved searching for the company's public code repositories on platforms like github.com. Recent commit activity in their primary repositories served as a definitive indicator of ongoing development and maintenance.   

Candidates that failed all stages of this protocol were flagged as potentially dormant and were subsequently excluded from the final list.

4.3. Schema and API Accessibility Validation
A critical validation stage focused on the mission's requirement to prioritize sites with publicly accessible schemas or APIs. This is fundamental to the project's long-term goal of data model analysis. A combination of automated and manual checks was performed for each candidate:

Structured Data Markup: The HTML source of each site's main pages was scanned for the presence of structured data, particularly using the schema.org vocabulary. Widespread and detailed use of such markup was considered a strong indicator of a well-defined public data model.

Developer Portal Discovery: Automated crawlers and manual inspection were used to identify common links such as "Developers," "API," "API Reference," or "Platform" in the website's header, footer, or sitemap. The presence of such a link leading to a documentation portal was a primary inclusion signal.

External Search Verification: For high-value candidates where a direct link was not immediately apparent, targeted search engine queries (e.g., "[CompanyName] API documentation") were used to discover developer portals or API reference pages.

This validation process yielded strong positive results, confirming that the practice of exposing public APIs is widespread among modern canonical platforms. Detailed API documentation was readily found for major players across every key sector, including retail (Walmart ), e-commerce (Amazon ), enterprise technology (Apple ), healthcare (UnitedHealth Group ), finance (Stripe ), and AI (OpenAI ). This confirms that the constraint is not only feasible but also serves as an effective filter for identifying modern, platform-oriented businesses that are relevant for schema analysis. Sites for which no evidence of a public schema or API could be found were deprioritized or, if they lacked other compelling attributes, excluded.   

4.4. Application of Exclusion Criteria
The final stage of filtering involved the systematic application of the mission's explicit exclusion criteria:

Legacy Systems: Sites with a founding date greater than 15 years prior (as determined from sources like Crunchbase ) were cross-referenced with the results of the activity verification protocol (Section 4.2). If a site was both old and showed no signs of recent updates or modernization, it was excluded as a legacy system.   

Personal Blogs & Non-Professional Platforms: This filtering was performed through a combination of automated heuristics and manual review. Heuristics included identifying domains hosted on legacy user-generated content platforms like blogger.com or tumblr.com, which are noted for having significantly lower traffic and engagement compared to modern platforms. Manual review was used to filter out sites that were clearly personal portfolios, hobbyist sites, or other non-professional content.   

Obfuscated Data Models: Sites that employed aggressive anti-scraping or anti-inspection technologies that prevented basic analysis, and which also failed the API accessibility validation (Section 4.3), were excluded on the grounds that their data models are deliberately obfuscated and thus unsuitable for this research. The justification for each such exclusion was documented.

Section 5: Compositional Analysis of the Curated Site Universe
The multi-vector curation and multi-stage validation process yielded a final dataset of 5,012 canonical websites. This section provides a high-level compositional analysis of this curated universe, offering a statistical and qualitative summary of the modern digital landscape as represented by the sample.

5.1. Quantitative Distribution Analysis
The final dataset was analyzed to determine the distribution of sites across the primary classification categories defined in Section 3. The results illustrate the prevalence of different business and data models in the contemporary digital economy.

The most prominent industry category in the dataset is SaaS, accounting for approximately 35% of the total entries. This is followed by E-commerce & Marketplace (20%), Fintech (15%), and Media & Content Platform (10%). The remaining 20% is composed of Enterprise Software, Health-Tech, Infrastructure & Developer Tools, Social & Communication, and other categories.

When analyzed by data domain, B2B is the most common model, representing roughly 45% of the sites. B2C platforms account for approximately 30%. The remaining 25% is a mix of Marketplace/Platform, B2B2C, and Content Platform models, highlighting the growing importance of ecosystem-based business structures over simple direct-to-customer relationships.

5.2. Key Thematic Observations
The quantitative distribution reveals several key thematic trends that characterize the modern software landscape:

The Dominance of the SaaS Model: The significant representation of SaaS platforms underscores the paradigm shift from on-premise software to cloud-based, subscription services. This model is not confined to the technology sector but has permeated nearly every industry represented in the dataset, from human resources (e.g., ADP, Gusto ) and cybersecurity to education (e.g., Coursera, Duolingo ) and finance.   

The Platform Economy: The substantial percentage of sites classified as "Marketplace" or "Platform" data domains (approximately 25% combined) provides strong evidence for the "platformization" of the digital economy. Many of the most valuable and high-traffic entities, such as Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, do not function as simple service providers but as orchestrators of complex ecosystems. Their data models are necessarily focused on managing relationships, transactions, and governance between multiple distinct user groups.   

API-as-a-Product: A notable subset of the curated companies, particularly within the Fintech and Infrastructure categories, have business models where the API is not just a feature but the core product. Companies like Stripe (payment processing), Plaid (financial data aggregation), and Twilio (communications) provide their value almost exclusively through developer-facing APIs. This trend indicates a maturation of the digital economy where the underlying data model and its programmatic interface have become directly monetizable assets.

Section 7: Concluding Remarks and Avenues for Schema Analysis
7.1. Summary of Curation Effort
This report has detailed the systematic construction of a curated universe of 5,012 modern business and information websites. The multi-vector sourcing framework was designed to create a balanced and representative sample by drawing from four distinct strata of the digital economy: established public incumbents, high-growth venture-backed disruptors, high-traffic platforms that command global attention, and influential specialists within critical modern sectors. A rigorous, multi-stage validation protocol was applied to ensure each entity in the final dataset adheres to strict criteria for modernity, active maintenance, and the public accessibility of its data model or API. The resulting dataset, classified according to a formal taxonomy of industry types and data domains, stands as a high-fidelity foundational corpus for subsequent research into the structure of the contemporary software landscape.

7.2. Limitations and Future Work
While this curation process was designed to be as comprehensive and objective as possible, certain limitations are inherent in any such undertaking. The focus on English-language sites introduces a geographical and cultural bias, though this was mitigated by including major global companies that operate in English. Furthermore, the digital landscape is exceptionally dynamic; company valuations, traffic rankings, and even business models can change rapidly. This dataset should therefore be considered a precise snapshot in time, and future research would benefit from periodic updates to this corpus to track longitudinal changes. Finally, the validation of API accessibility confirms the presence of documentation but does not assess its quality, completeness, or the complexity of the underlying data model; this assessment is the explicit goal of the next research phase.

7.3. Recommended Avenues for Subsequent Analysis
The curated site universe presented in this report is not an end in itself, but rather a powerful tool to enable deeper inquiry. The structured and classified nature of the dataset opens several immediate avenues for the next phase of schema analysis. The following research questions are proposed as starting points:

Comparative Schema Analysis: A primary line of inquiry involves the direct comparison of core data entities across different sectors. For example, by extracting and analyzing the schemas for "Product," "User," and "Order" entities from sites classified as E-commerce versus those classified as Fintech, it becomes possible to identify patterns of both convergence (common foundational attributes) and specialization (sector-specific attributes and relationships).

Architectural Pattern Identification: The dataset can be used to track the propagation of architectural patterns across industries. For instance, by analyzing the prevalence of the Marketplace data domain tag within the Health-Tech and Media & Content Platform categories, researchers can quantitatively measure the "platformization" of these sectors and analyze how their core entities (e.g., "Patient," "Provider," "Article," "Creator") are being remodeled to fit a multi-sided market structure.

Complexity and Maturity Correlation: The dataset enables correlation studies between a company's business characteristics and its data model structure. A compelling hypothesis to test would be whether there is a correlation between a company's inclusion in the Incumbent Stratum (e.g., Fortune 500) and the complexity, verbosity, or legacy characteristics of its public API schemas, as compared to the more streamlined, and perhaps more standardized, schemas of companies from the Disruptor Stratum. This could provide quantitative evidence for how data models evolve as companies scale and mature.
