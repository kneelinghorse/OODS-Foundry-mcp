# =============================================================================
# THE PROBLEM
# =============================================================================

problem: |
  We're trying to fit OODS into a traditional design system shell.

  Current nav proposal has:
  - "Components" as the biggest section
  - 3 Objects when objects should be CENTRAL
  - 1 Trait when traits should be FOUNDATIONAL
  - "Domains" that are really just specialized objects

  This is exactly backwards. OODS is NOT a component library.
  OODS is about Objects, Traits, and Contexts.

  We're telling the wrong story with what we have.

# =============================================================================
# RESEARCH OBJECTIVE
# =============================================================================

objective: |
  Use OODS Foundry's actual philosophy to derive a navigation structure
  that reflects what makes OODS different:

  1. Objects are central (not components)
  2. Traits are foundational building blocks
  3. Contexts determine how objects render
  4. Primitives support objects, not the other way around

  The navigation should TEACH the OODS approach, not hide it.

# =============================================================================
# OODS CORE CONCEPTS TO REFLECT
# =============================================================================

core_concepts:

  primitives:
    definition: |
      The raw UI building blocks. Buttons, inputs, tables.
      These SUPPORT objects - they don't stand alone.
    question: How do we present these as supporting cast, not stars?

  traits:
    definition: |
      Behaviors and capabilities that objects can have.
      Addressable, Classifiable, Statusable, Temporal, etc.
    current_state: Only showing Addressable
    question: |
      What traits do we actually have implemented?
      How do we showcase the trait ENGINE, not just one trait?

  objects:
    definition: |
      The things users care about. User, Organization, Product, Invoice, Subscription.
      Objects HAVE traits and RENDER in contexts.
    current_state: Only 3 objects shown (User, Organization, Product)
    question: |
      What objects exist in the codebase?
      How do we make objects the HERO of the navigation?

  contexts:
    definition: |
      How objects appear based on where they are.
      List, Detail, Form, Card, Timeline, Dashboard.
    current_state: View Profiles exist but poorly explained
    question: |
      How do we show the same object in different contexts?
      How do we demonstrate context-driven rendering?

# =============================================================================
# OODS DIFFERENTIATORS TO SHOWCASE
# =============================================================================

differentiators:

  accessibility_approach:
    what_we_have: |
      - Semantic HTML foundation
      - ARIA patterns
      - High contrast mode support
      - ForcedColors proof
      - Status-aware announcements
    where_its_shown: Buried, one useless report
    question: How do we make a11y visible as a first-class concern?

  trait_engine:
    what_it_is: |
      The system that composes traits onto objects.
      statusRegistry, trait composition, capability checking.
    where_its_shown: Nowhere obvious
    question: How do we demonstrate trait composition?

  tep_visualization:
    what_it_is: |
      Token-Expression Pipeline for data visualization.
      Normalized specs, adapters, renderer selection.
    where_its_shown: Scattered across viz stories
    question: How do we show the VIZ SYSTEM, not just charts?

  context_rendering:
    what_it_is: |
      RenderObject, ViewProfiles, context-aware display.
      Same object → different presentation based on context.
    where_its_shown: Proofs/view-profiles, Domain Context Gallery (mess)
    question: How do we make this the central demo?

  semantic_tokens:
    what_it_is: |
      Token architecture: Reference → Semantic → Component.
      Theme-aware, accessible color system.
    where_its_shown: Foundations/tokens
    question: Is the token STORY clear?

# =============================================================================
# RESEARCH TASKS
# =============================================================================

tasks:

  task_1_inventory_by_concept:
    description: |
      Re-inventory everything by OODS concept, not by file location.

      For each story/component, ask:
      - Is this a TRAIT demonstration?
      - Is this an OBJECT demonstration?
      - Is this a CONTEXT demonstration?
      - Is this a PRIMITIVE (supporting)?
      - Is this showing ACCESSIBILITY?
      - Is this showing the VIZ SYSTEM?

    output: List of what we have, categorized by OODS concept

  task_2_identify_gaps:
    description: |
      What's MISSING from telling the OODS story?

      - What traits exist but aren't shown?
      - What objects exist but aren't demoed?
      - What contexts exist but aren't clear?
      - Where is accessibility hidden?
      - Where is the trait engine demo?

    output: Gap analysis

  task_3_propose_oods_native_hierarchy:
    description: |
      Design a navigation that reflects OODS philosophy.

      NOT: Components → Objects → ...
      INSTEAD: Start with what makes OODS different.

      Consider:
      - "Understanding OODS" section that explains the approach
      - Objects as the main section
      - Traits shown as capabilities objects have
      - Contexts shown as how objects render
      - Primitives as supporting documentation
      - Accessibility as visible throughout
      - Viz system as a cohesive story

    output: Proposed hierarchy based on OODS philosophy

  task_4_story_mapping:
    description: |
      Map existing stories to the new OODS-native hierarchy.
      Where does each story belong in the new structure?

    output: Migration plan

# =============================================================================
# SUCCESS CRITERIA
# =============================================================================

success_criteria:
  - Navigation reflects OODS philosophy, not generic DS structure
  - Objects are central, not buried
  - Traits are visible as composable capabilities
  - Contexts demonstrate the rendering system
  - Accessibility is first-class, not hidden
  - Viz system tells a cohesive story
  - A new user learns OODS concepts from the nav structure

# OUTPUT

notes: |
  This is FOUNDATIONAL research.

  We cannot organize the Storybook until we know what story we're telling.
  The story is OODS - Objects, Traits, Contexts.
  Not "here's another design system with components."

  The navigation should be an embodiment of the OODS philosophy.
