Expert Report on Visual-to-Data Translation via Multimodal Large Language Models
I. Executive Summary and Strategic Blueprint
1.1 Strategic Thesis: V2D Translation for Design System Automation
Visual-to-Data (V2D) translation denotes the critical process of converting raw visual inputs, such as UI screenshots, mockups, and wireframes, into structured, machine-readable data formats. This technology marks a fundamental paradigm shift away from simple UI-to-Code generation towards sophisticated semantic and structural analysis. The overarching goal of V2D is not merely to produce executable front-end code, which is often brittle and context-dependent, but rather to extract the underlying configuration data—specifically, standardized design tokens and a hierarchical component structure—that can directly automate and inform enterprise design systems.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are the core technological enablers of this process, due to their unique capacity to interpret the visual intent and semantics of a design, extending beyond simple pixel recognition. Research confirms that MLLMs excel at extracting meaningful semantic attributes from UI designs, such as app categories, screen roles, and stylistic descriptions, which significantly outperforms traditional computer vision approaches.   

However, achieving production-grade reliability necessitates the implementation of a Hybrid AI Imperative. V2D translation must be architected as a multi-stage pipeline that integrates specialized computer vision models for deterministic tasks (e.g., component localization and segmentation) with MLLMs for complex, probabilistic reasoning (semantic labeling, contextual analysis). This integrated strategy must enforce strict structured data contracts, primarily governed by established JSON Schemas, to ensure output validity and mitigate the risk of MLLM hallucination.   

1.2 Key Research Findings and Build Feasibility (Snapshot)
The investigation into V2D translation highlights several critical architectural necessities and performance metrics:

Specialized Architecture: Generic MLLMs are insufficient for complex UI understanding. Specialized models like ScreenAI demonstrate the value of training models specifically on UI/infographic data, utilizing a unique textual representation of the UI hierarchy to enhance comprehension.   

Visual Grounding: MLLMs struggle with precise spatial localization. This is overcome by adopting Set-of-Mark (SoM) prompting, which uses external segmentation models to generate marked bounding boxes, allowing the MLLM to reference element IDs rather than generating coordinates probabilistically.   

Output Standardization: The output must conform to industry-recognized standards. The W3C Design Tokens Standard Schema is the mandated format for stylistic property extraction, ensuring high interoperability and integration into existing design systems.   

Accuracy Mitigation: While MLLMs can achieve high semantic accuracy, quantitative attribute extraction (e.g., color hex codes, measurements) exhibits an inherent empirical error rate. Approaches like PlotExtract, which employ iterative self-verification, establish that a robust post-processing refinement loop is required to drive the final error rate below the expected 5% residual error baseline for reliable data extraction.

II. Architectural and Technical Mechanisms of Visual-to-Data Translation
2.1 Foundational MLLM Architecture for UI Comprehension
A. Vision-Language Integration Fundamentals
Visual-Language Models (VLMs), the foundation of V2D translation, are inherently multimodal AI systems designed to map the complex relationships between visual data and text data. These models typically consist of two critical components: a Vision Encoder and a Language Encoder. The Vision Encoder (often a specialized deep learning architecture like ViT) processes visual input (images or videos), extracting vital properties such as colors, shapes, textures, and spatial relationships, and converting them into vector embeddings. Simultaneously, the Language Encoder, often a Transformer-based LLM (e.g., GPT or BERT variants), captures semantic meaning and contextual associations from textual prompts, converting them into text embeddings.   

The coherence of the V2D output—the highly structured JSON—is fundamentally dependent on the Cross-Modal Alignment Mechanism. This mechanism, exemplified by structures like the Q-Former in BLIP-2 architecture, aligns the visual representations from the image encoder with the text representations from the LLM, enabling powerful vision-language understanding. Any inaccuracy in this alignment leads directly to relational or attribute hallucinations, where the MLLM misattributes properties or misidentifies spatial relationships between components.   

B. Specialized UI Models: ScreenAI and Textual Representation
While general-purpose MLLMs have broad capabilities, their application to User Interface (UI) analysis is limited by the domain-specific visual language and design sophistication inherent in UIs and infographics. This limitation necessitates the adaptation or creation of specialized models.   

ScreenAI, developed by Google Research, is a notable example of a Vision-Language Model optimized specifically for UI comprehension. ScreenAI utilizes a hybrid PaLI and pix2struct architecture and is trained on mixtures covering a wide spectrum of UI and infographic tasks. A key technical differentiator of ScreenAI is its unique Textual UI Representation. This representation is introduced during the pretraining phase, leveraging self-supervised learning and LLM-driven data generation to create massive, autonomously labeled training datasets. This internal, structured textual representation allows the model to inherently understand layout hierarchies and element types, overcoming the challenge of direct pixel parsing and enabling efficient processing across various aspect ratios.   

The successful architectural approach of ScreenAI demonstrates a crucial principle: translating the raw visual context into a structured, internal textual proxy is essential for effective V2D translation. For the V2D pipeline, this mandates that the internal data flow must include a similar, structurally defined intermediate representation (e.g., a hierarchical UI Element Tree) before the final JSON output is generated, rather than relying solely on the MLLM’s raw visual processing capabilities.

2.2 Visual Grounding and Structural Decomposition Techniques
A. Fine-Grained Localization via Set-of-Mark (SoM) Prompting
A persistent technical challenge for MLLMs in the UI domain is predicting the precise spatial coordinates (x, y positions) and bounding boxes of specific, fine-grained components. This localization gap jeopardizes accurate attribute extraction, as stylistic properties (like color or typography) must be reliably linked to the correct component.   

The Set-of-Mark (SoM) prompting strategy provides an effective solution to this challenge. SoM addresses the localization weakness by preprocessing the input image using external, state-of-the-art segmentation models (such as Segment Anything Model or Mask DINO) to partition the image into distinct regions. These regions are then visually overlaid with spatial and speakable marks, such as alphanumeric identifiers or bounding boxes. When the MLLM is prompted for information extraction (e.g., "What is the background color of element A5?"), it grounds its response by selecting the appropriate marker ID, enabling highly accurate visual grounding. This approach has been shown to dramatically improve performance in object detection and referring segmentation tasks.   

The necessity of SoM prompting dictates a core architectural requirement: the V2D pipeline must incorporate a high-performance, specialized UI Element Detection (UIED) algorithm as a mandatory preprocessing step. This vision model must run prior to MLLM inference to generate the foundational bounding boxes and marked input image necessary for the MLLM's subsequent structured analysis.

B. Structural Decomposition and Token Compression
Efficiency and validity of MLLM-generated structured data are significantly hindered by the computational overhead associated with large volumes of visual and code tokens. This redundancy not only increases resource consumption but also dilutes the MLLM's focus, frequently resulting in overly lengthy or structurally invalid outputs.   

Sophisticated V2D architectures employ decomposition and compression strategies to enforce engineering discipline. The Divide-and-Conquer (DCGen) approach segments a full screenshot, generates descriptions or code for individual segments, and then merges these partial solutions to produce the complete UI structure. This technique ensures local structural accuracy before global assembly, improving both visual and code similarity metrics.   

A more refined technique is the Element and Layout-aware Token Compression (ELTC) used in systems like EfficientUICoder. This method begins with UI Element Detection (UIED) to extract bounding boxes. It then constructs a UI Element Graph where nodes represent elements and edges represent the shortest spatial link between them. By applying Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm to this graph, the system derives an optimal, acyclic UI Element Tree. This structured tree provides the most efficient, minimal representation of the UI’s structure and semantics, ready for ingestion by the MLLM.   

The implementation of these decomposition methods serves a purpose beyond mere efficiency; they impose critical engineering priors on the MLLM. By reducing the visual input space to a concise, hierarchically structured tree of relationships (the MST tree), the model is far less likely to hallucinate an invalid or unnecessarily complex component hierarchy. This structured input directly enhances the validity and precision of the final structured data output.

2.3 Extracting UI Structure from Websites and Web Apps
The extraction process for complex web UIs and web applications must recognize the underlying architectural principles of modern software design, particularly the separation of concerns, such as the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. The system must ensure that the extracted visual structure (the View) accurately reflects the design hierarchy without attempting to infer or manipulate the underlying data model (Model/ViewModel), which can introduce business logic errors.   

Effective structural extraction requires an explicit methodology, often executed by an internal "Planning Agent," as seen in ScreenCoder models. This agent organizes the detected components (detected via UIED) into a logical, hierarchical layout (e.g., grouping elements into a 'header', 'navbar', 'sidebar', and 'content') by applying established front-end engineering principles.   

Furthermore, accurate structural and content extraction relies heavily on the quality of text handling. A crucial, non-negotiable preprocessing step is Reading Order Detection. In complex, multi-column or dynamically arranged web pages, coherent text chunks and semantically meaningful embeddings depend on correctly identifying the logical flow of content. Failure to accurately order text and align it with its associated UI context compromises the semantic mapping capability of the MLLM. Low-latency pipelines must be employed to optimize speed and accuracy for this extraction and contextual alignment process.   

III. The Output Standard: Structured Data Formats and Schemas
3.1 The Imperative of Structured Data over Textual Output
For V2D translation to be successful in an engineering context, the output must be robust, predictable, and immediately machine-usable. This mandates the strict generation of structured data, typically JSON, rather than relying on unstructured text descriptions.

Structured data, enforced via defined schema constraints (e.g., JSON Schema), serves as the primary technical defense against MLLM limitations, notably hallucination. MLLM hallucinations are particularly problematic because the false or misleading content often appears contextually plausible, making it difficult to detect without ground truth. By forcing the MLLM output into a rigid JSON structure, the system prevents the model from generating information that does not conform to defined types, keys, and enumeration values.   

Modern LLM platforms support Structured Outputs features, which ensure reliable type-safety. Using libraries such as Pydantic (Python) or Zod (JavaScript), developers can define the target schema programmatically, and the MLLM runtime guarantees that the output adheres to these rules. This explicit enforcement eliminates the need for extensive post-generation validation and retry logic, streamlining the pipeline and enabling explicit refusals to be programmatically detectable.   

3.2 Prescribing W3C Design Tokens for Style and Property Extraction
A. Strategic Rationale for W3C Design Tokens
The core purpose of V2D in a design system context is to define components and their styles as data. Therefore, the generated output must be standardized and interoperable. The W3C Design Tokens Standard Schema is the mandated format for stylistic extraction because it provides a common foundation for sharing design system elements (colors, fonts, measurements) across different tools, platforms, and products.   

Defining components and their styles as structured JSON data is considered the "ultimate source of truth" for design systems. This architecture, known as "Components as Data," is optimal because MLLMs are highly efficient when processing structured inputs and generating structured outputs, making the translation process more precise than attempting to parse ambiguous visual context.   

B. Data Modeling for Stylistic Attributes
The V2D output must map detected visual attributes to the W3C structure, which minimally requires the definition of the $type (e.g., color, spacing) and the $value. Critically, the standard supports both concrete values (e.g., #000000) and aliases, where the $value references another token (e.g., {color.black} or {color.primary}).   

For sophisticated design systems, the MLLM should be prompted to capture and output semantic aliases whenever context is provided (e.g., through few-shot examples or external design system documentation). A design token also includes a self-explanatory name (e.g., md.fab.container.color) and an associated value, ensuring the token's purpose remains consistent even if the underlying value changes. The inclusion of a description field, which captures the semantic meaning inferred by the MLLM (e.g., "Main button background"), adds essential context for downstream adoption and indexing.   

The structure below outlines the required W3C schema compliance for a typical color token extraction:

W3C Design Token Standard Schema Example: Color

Field	Description	Requirement	Source(s)
$type	Semantic category (e.g., color, spacing, font).	Must be extracted from visual properties and categorized correctly.	
$value	The raw value or a reference (alias) to another token.	Must be compliant (e.g., valid HEX, RGBA components, or alias string).	
description	Semantic meaning captured by MLLM (e.g., "Main button background").	Provides essential context for design system adoption.	
$extensions	Tool-specific metadata (e.g., link to a specific Figma component).	Reserved for tool chain integration.	
  
3.3 Data Modeling for UI Layout and Component Hierarchy
Beyond stylistic tokens, the V2D output must rigorously define the UI layout and component hierarchy. This structural information must be captured using standard JSON Schema compliant with specifications such as v4 or the 2012-20 version, as these schemas provide the structural integrity needed to represent complex component trees and properties.   

Layout representation should categorize structure using principles similar to JSON Forms, which define the organization through Controls (individual component properties) and Layouts (containers like grids, headers, sidebars). This representation ensures that the output is not just a list of tokens but an organized map of the screen architecture, facilitating the creation of scaffolding code or hierarchical rendering.   

The MLLM's strength in semantic interpretation should be leveraged to enrich the schema with meaningful metadata. The schema must incorporate fields for semantic attributes that aid design research, such as:   

App Category: The high-level function of the application.

Screen Role: The specific purpose of the screen (e.g., Checkout, Dashboard, Settings).

Target Users: Inferred or supplied demographic/role information.

Subjective Properties: Properties like 'mood' or 'style', which MLLMs can extract with varying consistency.   

IV. Performance Metrics, Model Benchmarks, and Quantitative Assessment
4.1 Defining Accuracy in Visual-to-Data Translation
V2D translation success must be measured against two distinct criteria:

Semantic Accuracy (Correctness of Intent): This qualitative assessment measures whether the MLLM correctly categorizes the component (e.g., recognizing an element as a 'Primary Button' rather than an 'Image') and whether the semantic descriptors (e.g., labeling a color as primary or secondary, or inferring the correct screen role) align with human judgment. MLLMs generally show strength in understanding multiple UI semantics.   

Quantitative Accuracy (Precision of Data): This objective metric measures the error rate in extracted numerical values, such as color HEX codes, spacing units, and typography sizes. Quantitative accuracy is non-negotiable for engineering use, as even a single-digit error in a HEX code renders the output invalid for production.   

Achieving production-grade quantitative accuracy requires rigorous mitigation. Research involving MLLMs applied to numerical data extraction (e.g., digitizing plots via PlotExtract) has demonstrated that even with advanced techniques like code generation and self-verification, an average relative error of 5% or less remains the empirical baseline for numerical output. This 5% figure establishes the residual error the V2D system must be designed to actively detect and correct in the post-processing phase.   

For critical data fields where error is intolerable, the standard must align with benchmarks for human data entry. Manual data entry for critical information typically maintains a very low error rate, sometimes ranging from 0.1% to 0.9%. The V2D pipeline must incorporate the necessary verification steps to meet or surpass this sub-1% accuracy target for all extracted design tokens.   

4.2 Comparative Analysis of Leading MLLMs
Selecting the optimal MLLM for V2D translation requires assessing capabilities relevant to generating highly structured, technically accurate outputs. Since generating structured JSON that conforms to a complex schema is functionally analogous to code generation, performance on coding and technical reasoning benchmarks serves as a strong proxy for V2D efficacy.

Current benchmarks indicate nuanced differences:

Code Generation Proficiency: Claude 4 (Opus and Sonnet) models have demonstrated superior performance on benchmarks like SWE-bench, achieving results around 72.5% to 72.7%. This significantly surpasses competitors such as GPT-4.1 (54.6%) and Gemini (63.8%). This dominance in complex code generation suggests that Claude models may offer the highest reliability in generating complex, multi-layered JSON outputs that strictly adhere to the W3C Design Tokens standard.   

General Reasoning and Contextualization: For interpreting complex design logic and contextualizing semantic extraction, models like Gemini 3 and GPT-4 remain the state-of-the-art in general reasoning and knowledge.   

Technical Comprehension Gaps: Despite their advanced capabilities, models tested on engineering-focused benchmarks (like DesignQA) struggle with reliably retrieving relevant rules from external technical documentation and analyzing complex engineering drawings. This gap in technical comprehension reinforces the necessity of explicitly feeding the MLLM design system rules, usage guidelines, and semantic definitions as part of the prompt context, rather than relying solely on visual interpretation.   

The following table summarizes the comparative landscape for V2D-relevant tasks:

Comparative MLLM Performance in V2D-Relevant Tasks (Approximate Benchmarks)

Model	Category	Benchmark/Proxy Task	Reported Metric/Finding	Source(s)
Claude 4 (Opus/Sonnet)	Coding/Generation	SWE-bench (Code generation/refactoring)	Dominates (72.5% - 72.7%), highest structural output reliability proxy.	
Gemini 3 / GPT-4	General Reasoning	MMLU/Complex Exams	Strongest general reasoning base, critical for semantic inference.	
GPT-4o, Claude, Llama	UI Evaluation	MLLM-as-a-Judge (UI preference)	Approximates human preferences but requires human validation for divergence points.	
GPT-4o, Claude-Opus, Gemini-1.0	Technical Comprehension	DesignQA (Engineering requirements)	Struggles to reliably retrieve rules and analyze complex technical visuals.	
  
4.3 Granular Accuracy Assessment for Design Attributes
Specific design attributes present unique extraction challenges:

Color Extraction: While MLLMs can precisely extract the raw color value (e.g., the HEX code) , they demonstrate inconsistency in the crucial task of identifying the semantic hierarchy (e.g., differentiating primary, secondary, or accent colors). Furthermore, the generated descriptions of color schemes are often deemed too broad or generic by human evaluators. To overcome this, the V2D pipeline must either provide explicit semantic context (e.g., naming conventions used in the design system) or rely on the post-processing refinement loop to validate semantic assignments.   

Typography and OCR Reliance: Typography extraction (font family, size, weight) inherently relies on the MLLM's underlying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. OCR is susceptible to common errors, such as character misrecognition ('0' as 'O' or '1' as 'l'), which directly impacts the accuracy of text content and numerical font sizes. OCR also tends to destroy original structural formatting, such as table layouts. Because MLLMs incorporate OCR for text elements, the V2D pipeline must explicitly account for these deficiencies by incorporating an LLM-driven post-processing stage. This stage is dedicated to refining OCR output, correcting transcription errors, and ensuring the extracted text attributes and content are compliant with the structured schema.   

V. Limitations, Error Mitigation, and Handling UI Complexity
5.1 Inherent MLLM Limitations and Visual Hallucination
Despite advancements, MLLMs possess intrinsic limitations that pose direct risks to V2D reliability. Visual hallucination is the most significant concern, categorized into three types relevant to UI extraction :   

Category Hallucination: Identifying a nonexistent object category or incorrectly classifying a component type (e.g., calling a dropdown a text input).

Attribute Hallucination: Correctly identifying the object category but assigning incorrect attributes, such as wrong color, content, or size. This is the most critical risk for the accuracy of design tokens.   

Relational Hallucination: Correctly identifying objects and their attributes but incorrectly describing their relationship, such as an incorrect component hierarchy or spatial positioning.   

To mitigate these risks, the V2D system must integrate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques. UQ allows the system to assess the MLLM’s confidence in its generated output at runtime, without relying on pre-existing ground truth data. Techniques like White-box UQ (using token probabilities) or Black-box UQ (measuring semantic agreement across multiple generations) can be employed. Low confidence scores should immediately flag the extracted attributes or structural elements for mandatory human review or automatic self-verification, ensuring that potentially false information is not integrated into the design system.   

5.2 Challenges in Capturing Dynamic State and Responsive Design
MLLMs are limited to processing static snapshots of a user interface. Consequently, they fundamentally struggle to infer information related to dynamic UI states, component interactions (e.g., hover effects, focused states), or animations. These dynamic properties, crucial for design systems, must either be supplied via text documentation or captured through multiple, explicitly labeled visual inputs (e.g., an image of the "default" state and an image of the "hover" state).   

A single screenshot is also inherently insufficient for extracting the rules governing Responsive Design. Responsive design depends on the ability of the interface to adjust across different screen sizes and orientations while maintaining user-friendly consistency. To capture this, the V2D pipeline must adopt a multi-view analysis framework. This framework requires processing multiple screenshots taken at defined breakpoints (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop view). The system must then employ techniques such as consistency regularization or cross-modal coherence optimization to ensure that component properties and structural relationships extracted from these different views remain coherent and logically consistent.   

Furthermore, the introduction of complex, multi-stage processing involving MLLM inference and iterative refinement loops introduces significant operational challenges, specifically concerning latency and cost-effectiveness. The required use of token compression (ELTC)  and reliance on high-speed, low-latency preprocessing pipelines for simple extraction tasks  become critical engineering considerations to maintain feasibility in production environments.   

5.3 Prescriptive Mitigation Strategies (Preprocessing and Post-processing)
Reliable V2D requires a robust pipeline that manages errors both before (Preprocessing) and after (Post-processing) the primary MLLM inference stage.

A. Preprocessing Requirements (Optimizing Input)
The goal of preprocessing is to convert the unstructured visual data into the most structured, high-quality input possible for the MLLM:

Structural Grounding: Mandatory execution of UI Element Detection (UIED) to segment the image and generate bounding boxes. This structure then forms the basis for the UI Element Tree, which serves as a minimal, clean input structure, reducing token consumption.   

Contextual Alignment: Utilizing specialized, low-latency pipelines is essential for data cleansing, noise reduction, and the critical step of Reading Order Detection. By ensuring text is extracted coherently and aligned logically, the MLLM can focus on high-quality information, leading to more reliable pattern identification.   

Visual Prompting: The output of UIED must be used to generate the Set-of-Mark (SoM) visual prompt overlay, enabling the MLLM to perform fine-grained spatial grounding accurately.   

B. Post-processing Requirements (Validation and Refinement)
Post-processing acts as the final quality control layer, ensuring the extracted data is compliant and quantitatively accurate:

Schema Enforcement: Strict, programmatic validation of all MLLM JSON outputs using frameworks like Pydantic or Zod is mandatory. This serves as the final gate for structural integrity and ensures W3C Design Token compliance.   

LLM-Driven Self-Verification Loop: To achieve the required engineering-grade accuracy (>99%) for quantitative attributes, the system must implement a refinement loop. This mechanism involves using the extracted data (e.g., color values, plot points, measurements) to procedurally generate a validation artifact (e.g., a small image or graphical element). The MLLM is then prompted to compare this generated artifact against the original source image. Any visual discrepancy identified by the model triggers an automatic re-prompt or corrective mechanism, dramatically lowering the residual error rate for critical quantitative properties.   

The technical architecture demands explicit commitment to these external tooling and verification steps:

Preprocessing and Post-processing Requirements for V2D Accuracy

Stage	Technique/Component	Primary Function/Output	Source(s)
Preprocessing (Visual)	UI Element Detection (UIED) + ELTC	Generates bounding boxes, structural graph, and minimum token representation.	
Preprocessing (Textual)	Reading Order Detection / Smart Chunking	Extracts coherent text context and aligns it logically for MLLM prompting.	
Inference (Prompting)	Set-of-Mark (SoM) Prompting	Achieves fine-grained spatial grounding for precise attribute linkage.	
Post-processing (Structural)	JSON Schema Validation (Pydantic/Zod)	Enforces W3C compliance and structural integrity against hallucination.	
Post-processing (Attribute)	LLM-Driven Refinement Loop	Validates numerical/stylistic attributes against the source image for error correction.
