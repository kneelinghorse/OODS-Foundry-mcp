objective: >
  Author the Brownfield Adoption Guide v1: document incremental integration steps for teams adopting
  traits/objects/tokens, including Figma + Storybook validation flows, CLI recipes, and tenancy/compliance hooks.

context: |
  Sprint 17 direction emphasizes enabling brownfield adoption once convergence layers land (cmos/docs/
  OODS Direction-Check-for-sprint-17.md:97-103). Prior sprints produced onboarding quickstarts (S15) and
  agent recipes; this mission consolidates them with the new compliance/billing capabilities, giving
  product teams a step-by-step path to layer OODS Foundry into existing apps. The guide should include
  reference architectures, CLI scripts, Storybook/VR validation flow, and cross-links to research
  underpinning decisions.

successCriteria:
  - "docs/adoption/brownfield-guide.md published with narrative + diagrams, covering Figma, tokens, RBAC, tenancy."
  - "Checklists + CLI recipes (e.g., `pnpm adoption:audit`) verifying compliance + tenancy toggles in brownfield sample."
  - "Storybook Explorer note: Brownfield Adoption deck referencing core objects and proofs."
  - "Updated onboarding quickstarts linking to Brownfield guide; docs build passes."
  - "Feedback loop established (issue template or doc) for teams to request adoption support."

deliverables:
  - "docs/adoption/brownfield-guide.md + assets under docs/adoption/assets/*."
  - "CLI scripts: scripts/adoption/{audit.mjs,storybook-checklist.mjs}."
  - "Storybook MDX page: stories/docs/Brownfield.adoption.mdx."
  - "Doc updates in docs/onboarding/{design-quickstart.md,dev-quickstart.md}."
  - "Feedback template: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adoption-support.yml."
