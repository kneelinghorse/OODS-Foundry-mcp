title: "End-of-Sprint Summary & Health Snapshot (Sprint 13)"
type: "Build.Implementation.v1"

objective: >
  Produce a concise, decision-ready summary for Sprint 13 and a consolidated diagnostics snapshot,
  stored under /artifacts/current-state/YYYY-MM-DD/. Cap the folder at ≤10 files.


deliverables:
  - "/artifacts/current-state/YYYY-MM-DD/sprint-13-summary.md"
  - "/artifacts/current-state/YYYY-MM-DD/diagnostics.json"

steps:
  - "Run diag.snapshot with domain section (billing counts, stories, enum coverage, mapping integrity)."
  - "Write sprint-13-summary.md (scope delivered, metrics, risks, inputs to Sprint 14)."
  - "Validate ≤10 files in the dated folder; inline tables if needed."

tests:
  - "diagnostics.json contains billing keys (enum coverage %, fixtures used, story counts)."
  - "Links in summary resolve to files in the same folder."
  - "Artifact count validator passes (≤10)."

acceptance:
  - "Summary + diagnostics saved; ready inputs to plan Sprint 14."
