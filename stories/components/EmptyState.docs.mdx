# EmptyState

Empty states set expectations when there is no data, the user is onboarding, or a flow is complete. The component aligns illustration, headline, body copy, and actions with Statusables tone tokens so the messaging and visual language stay consistent across products.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.NoData} />

## Anatomy

1. **Illustration** (optional) — branded hero artwork for first-use or celebratory states.  
2. **Icon** (optional) — compact intent glyph when illustration is omitted.  
3. **Headline** — short statement rendered with `headlineLevel` (default `h2`).  
4. **Body** — supporting copy that clarifies what happened or what to do next.  
5. **Primary action** — dominant call-to-action exposed via `primaryAction`.  
6. **Secondary action** — alternate or supporting choice via `secondaryAction`.  
7. **Additional actions** — tertiary links or custom markup provided through `actions`.

## Content Checklist

### ✅ Do

- Keep the headline to 3–7 words and reuse product vocabulary.  
- Use the body to explain *why* the state occurred and suggest a next step.  
- Pair `primaryAction` with an imperative verb (“Create project”, “Upgrade plan”).  
- Use `secondaryAction` for a single alternate path (help docs, import flows).  
- Map states to the product journey: first-use, empty/no data, success/completion.

### 🚫 Avoid

- Repeating the headline in the body copy.  
- Stacking more than two primary buttons or ambiguous labels (“Click here”).  
- Introducing new concepts that weren’t taught elsewhere in the flow.  
- Leaving the user with no action when it is possible to recover.

## Tone & Statusables Alignment

| Prop | Statusables tone | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intent="neutral"` | `var(--cmp-status-neutral-{surface,text,border})` | Passive states when nothing urgent is required. |
| `intent="info"` | `var(--cmp-status-info-*)` | Informational or guidance states (e.g., filters, read-only views). |
| `intent="success"` | `var(--cmp-status-success-*)` | Completion and celebratory messaging. |
| `intent="warning"` | `var(--cmp-status-warning-*)` | Attention needed, but not blocking. |
| `status="⋯"` | Derived from `statusRegistry` | Overrides tone/icon from Statusables taxonomy (e.g., `subscription.trialing`). |

`EmptyState` exposes `--empty-state-icon-{background,foreground,border}` variables so design tokens or themes can plug into governance pipelines.

### Status-Driven Example

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.StatusDriven} />

## Illustration Guidance

- Use illustrations for first-run, brand, or celebratory states where delight matters.  
- Prefer icons for transient or data-driven states (search, filters, inbox zero).  
- Keep artwork lightweight, with a max width of 16rem (12rem on mobile).  
- Treat decorative illustrations as `aria-hidden`; describe meaningful imagery in body copy.

## Accessibility

- Default heading level is `h2`; adjust via `headlineLevel` to keep the page outline valid.  
- All illustrations/icons are rendered `aria-hidden`—ensure text conveys the full message.  
- Buttons are standard HTML elements; focus order follows document flow.  
- Component snapshots include axe coverage (`tests/components/empty-state.spec.tsx`).
