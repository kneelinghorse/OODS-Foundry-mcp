version: "1.0.0"
displayName: "Implementation Mission"

missionId: "BI-20251101-191"

objective: >
  Complete a cross-brand polish and QA sweep for Component Set IV (Progress/Stepper, Tabs, Pagination,
  Breadcrumbs, Empty State, Toast queue), ensuring accessibility, visual regression, and documentation
  standards are met ahead of packaging.

context: |
  Sprint 18 introduces six high-impact components. Before packaging we want a focused pass that re-tests
  brands, HC mode, and keyboard flows; aligns Storybook docs with final APIs; and resolves any findings
  raised during research sign-off. The latest state assessment (2025-10-28) flagged domain context gaps,
  Storybook taxonomy drift, and token governance breaks (high-risk additions + CSS literals). This mission
  absorbs that cleanup so the kit is stable before packaging. It coordinates with perf/guardrail work so
  design + eng reviewers can sign off on a stable kit.

successCriteria:
  - "Cross-brand manual QA matrix executed and archived (light/dark/HC, keyboard, screen reader notes)."
  - "VR/a11y baselines refreshed for updated stories; Chromatic & axe runs green."
  - "Storybook docs include usage guidance, token references, and intent tables per component."
  - "Domain views assessment shows no missing contexts (artifacts/state/domains.json gaps array empty)."
  - "Storybook taxonomy matches allowed roots (extras removed and documented)."
  - "Token governance diff and CSS purity checks pass without high-risk alerts; breaking label applied if needed."
  - "Open issues from Sprint 18 component builds triaged and closed or logged with owners."
  - "Design sign-off notes captured in docs/changelog/sprint-19.md."

deliverables:
  - "QA matrix: docs/qa/component-set-iv-checklist.md (with findings + follow-up)."
  - "Updated Storybook stories/docs for component set IV under stories/components/ and stories/docs/."
  - "artifacts/state/domains.json updated via state assessment with all contexts covered."
  - "Tokens governance + purity reports (artifacts/state/tokens.json, artifacts/state/governance/*) showing green status."
  - "Chromatic + axe run artifacts linked in diagnostics.json and artifacts/state/."
  - "Summary entry in docs/changelog/sprint-19.md."
