title: Verification & Stabilization
status: Queued
sprint: Sprint 37
created: 2025-12-03
tags: [verification, stabilization, qa, foundation]

objective: |
  Verify that Sprint 36's navigation restructure work is stable before building
  Phase 2 hero demos on top of it. This is Sprint 37's "Sprint 0" task.

context: |
  Sprint 36 renamed ~75 story titles and reconfigured Storybook navigation.
  Before adding new content, we need confidence the foundation is solid.

  This prevents building on unstable ground and catching issues early.

      Run verification checklist:

      1. BUILD CHECK
         - Run: pnpm build-storybook
         - Expected: Build succeeds with no errors
         - Document any warnings

      2. DEV CHECK
         - Run: pnpm storybook
         - Expected: Dev server starts, navigation loads correctly
         - Verify new hierarchy is visible (Understanding OODS at top, etc.)

      3. CI CHECK
         - Review any broken snapshot tests or link checks
         - Check GitHub Actions if applicable

      4. VISUAL SPOT-CHECK
         - Verify 5-10 random stories render correctly:
           * stories/docs/1-philosophy.mdx
           * stories/docs/2-core-concepts.mdx
           * One Object story
           * One Trait story
           * One Viz story
           * One Primitives story
         - Note any rendering issues

      5. NAV STRUCTURE CHECK
         - Screenshot or document current nav hierarchy
         - Verify sections appear in correct order
         - Note any stories appearing in wrong sections

  - path: cmos/reports/sprint-37-verification.md
    action: create

      Document verification results:
      - Build status (pass/fail + warnings)
      - Dev server status
      - CI status
      - Visual spot-check results
      - Nav structure verification
      - List of any issues found
      - Recommended fixes before proceeding

success_criteria:
