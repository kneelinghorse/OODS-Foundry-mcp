missionId: "BR-20251101-195"

objective: >
  Publish the Storybook static build to GitHub Pages using an automated GitHub Actions workflow so
  stakeholders can browse the design system without cloning the repository.

context: |
  Research mission R19.5 compared hosting options and surfaced GitHub Pages as the simplest short-term
  solution for public access. We need a lightweight deployment pipeline that builds Storybook on each
  main-branch change, pushes the static bundle to Pages, and documents how maintainers monitor and update
  the display site. This mission keeps the footprint minimal while leaving room to pivot to Chromatic or
  other managed platforms if governance needs evolve.

successCriteria:
  - "GitHub Actions workflow builds Storybook and publishes to GitHub Pages on main branch updates."
  - "Pages configuration uses the modern artifact deployment model (no checked-in storybook-static)."
  - "Docs explain how to trigger deploys, validate the hosted Storybook, and recover from failures."
  - "Link to the hosted site added to the project README or docs index for quick discovery."

deliverables:
  - ".github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml (or equivalent) with caching and artifact deployment."
  - "Repository Pages settings configured for Actions with deployment status documented."
  - "docs/display-site/README.md (or update to existing docs) describing usage and maintenance."
  - "Status note in docs/changelog/sprint-19.md summarizing the deployment."

  releaseScope:
    includes:
      - "GitHub Actions workflow to build Storybook and upload to Pages."
      - "Custom domain or URL configuration (if needed) and caching headers."

    excludes:
      - "Advanced access control or review workflows (Chromatic/Vercel remain future pivots)."
      - "Full marketing site or additional content beyond Storybook."

  handoffContext:
    completed:
      - "Workflow merged to main and deployment verified."
      - "Docs updated with deployment and troubleshooting guidance."
