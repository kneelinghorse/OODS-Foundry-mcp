version: "1.0.0"
displayName: "Implementation Mission"

missionId: "BI-20251020-1610c"

objective: >
  Replace Explorer’s hand-authored Billing demos with real engine-backed Domain stories for Invoice
  and Subscription, using RenderObject + View Profiles + Trait Contributions so Billing respects
  tokens/brands/HC and aligns with the rest of the system.

context: |
  Current Billing stories (Invoice.* and Subscription.* under apps/explorer) bypass the engine and
  use bespoke layout/styles, so they neither exercise tokens nor reflect context regions. This
  mission ports Billing into the canonical path with realistic fixtures and removes the one-offs.

successCriteria:
  - "New Domains/Billing stories render Invoice and Subscription via RenderObject across detail/list/form/timeline."
  - "Stories consume view-profiles + trait contributions (status, tags, actions, timeline)."
  - "All visuals come from semantic tokens; brand/light/dark/HC toggles work as expected."
  - "Explorer one-offs removed or clearly moved under Patterns/Explorer with warning labels."
  - "Axe smoke on Billing curated set = 0 violations; VR dry-run shows expected structural diffs only."

deliverables:
  - "stories/domains/Billing/*.stories.tsx using RenderObject"
  - "fixtures/billing/invoice.json, fixtures/billing/subscription.json with events/actions/status"
  - "Removal or relocation PR for apps/explorer Billing pages + a migration note in docs"
  - "artifacts/domains/billing-port-report.md (files moved, fixtures added, screenshots)"
