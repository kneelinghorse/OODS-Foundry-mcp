# OODS Foundry v1.0 Release Notes

**Release period:** Sprints 01–19 · Finalized October 29, 2025  
**Scope:** Trait engine + registry, multi-context view system, DTCG token pipeline, guardrail automation, reproducible packaging, and compliance-ready evidence.

## TL;DR

- Component Set IV (Progress/Stepper, Tabs, Pagination, Breadcrumbs, Empty State, Toast) cleared full QA with 754/754 tests, WCAG AA audits, and Chromatic + HC baselines ([docs/changelog/sprint-19.md](../changelog/sprint-19.md)).
- Release dry run produced deterministic tarballs, SBOM, and provenance bundles for `@oods/trait-engine`, `@oods/tokens`, `@oods/tw-variants`, and `@oods/a11y-tools`, following the runbook + checklist in `docs/releases/`.
- Guardrail, governance, and compliance audits (ΔL/ΔC, token risk labels, Chromatic brand comparisons) completed for the RC freeze (see `docs/compliance/v1-audit-report.md`).
- Documentation refresh covers README, getting-started flows, adoption guides, and this release/migration duo so reviewers have a single source of truth.

## Packages & Artifacts

| Package | Version | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `@oods/trait-engine` | 0.1.0 | Deterministic trait compositor + CLI utilities (`src/core`, `src/cli`). |
| `@oods/tokens` | 0.1.0 | DTCG JSON → CSS variables via Style Dictionary v4 (`packages/tokens`). |
| `@oods/tw-variants` | 0.1.0 | Tailwind v4 adapters consuming emitted CSS variables. |
| `@oods/a11y-tools` | 0.1.0 | Axe + guardrail harness used by `pnpm a11y:check`/`a11y:diff`. |

Artifacts generated by `pnpm release:dry-run` and `scripts/release/local-release.sh` live in `dist/releases/<ts>/` and `artifacts/release-dry-run/<ts>/` per [runbook](runbook.md) + [checklist](release-checklist.md).

## Highlights by Pillar

### Trait Engine & Object Registry
- Deterministic merge cascade (foundation → base → traits → overrides → context) with provenance tracking and collision policies is documented in [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](../../IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) and enforced by `src/core/compositor.ts` + `tests/core/compositor.test.ts` (21 dedicated suites, 135 assertions).
- Object registry + generators cover canonical domains (`objects/`, `src/generators/`), with CLI workflows under `src/cli/object-commands.ts` for compose/validate/list tasks.

### Context-Aware View Engine
- Regions + modifiers drive List/Detail/Form/Timeline rendering (`docs/specs/regions.md`, `docs/patterns/modifier-purity.md`).
- Components remain tokens-only; context-aware stories live under `stories/` and `.storybook/` to showcase region coverage.

### Token System & Theming
- Brand A light/dark/high-contrast palettes ship via `packages/tokens/src/tokens/*` and are validated through `pnpm build:tokens`, `pnpm tokens:guardrails`, and `pnpm tokens:governance`.
- Governance outputs (`artifacts/state/governance/brand-*.json`) prove low-risk deltas only, with breaking labels applied when required (`docs/compliance/v1-audit-report.md`).

### Guardrails, Accessibility, & Diagnostics
- Guardrail automation expanded in Sprint 19 (metadata + tenancy ESLint rules, diagnostics tie-ins) per [docs/changelog/sprint-19.md](../changelog/sprint-19.md).
- Accessibility sweeps (`pnpm a11y:check`, `pnpm a11y:diff`) log 49 axe checks and 6 guardrail checks per run, captured in `tools/a11y/reports/a11y-report.json`.
- Diagnostics snapshots consolidate tokens, guardrails, VRT, and packaging health in `diagnostics.json` and `artifacts/state/*.json`.

### Release Engineering & Evidence
- Packaging dry run + provenance bundle recorded under `artifacts/release-dry-run/<ts>/` with SHA-256 + SBOM + bundle index. Process is documented in [docs/releases/runbook.md](runbook.md) and enforced by [docs/releases/release-checklist.md](release-checklist.md).
- Compliance audit for the RC (Mission B20.2) confirms guardrail + governance gates and provides human/machine-readable evidence (`docs/compliance/v1-audit-report.md`).

## Evidence Snapshot (Sprint 19)

| Check | Result | Source |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Unit tests | 754 / 754 passing in 7.28s | `docs/changelog/sprint-19.md` |
| Chromatic | 20 snapshots, 0 diffs; Brand A/B comparison artifacts ✅ | `docs/changelog/sprint-19.md`, `docs/compliance/v1-audit-report.md` |
| High-contrast VRT | HC PNGs captured via `pnpm vrt:hc` | `docs/changelog/sprint-19.md` |
| Axe + guardrail sweep | 49 axe, 6 guardrail, 12 contract checks (all pass) | `docs/changelog/sprint-19.md`, `docs/compliance/v1-audit-report.md` |
| Token governance | GREEN, no orphans/leaks, breaking labels applied | `docs/compliance/v1-audit-report.md` |
| Packaging | Deterministic tarballs + SBOM + bundle index ✅ | `docs/changelog/sprint-19.md`, `docs/releases/runbook.md` |

## Documentation Refresh

- `README.md` now covers v1.0 status, accurate scripts, CMOS mission control, and updated roadmap pointers.
- `docs/releases/v1.0-migration-guide.md` pairs with this document to guide brownfield consumers from legacy traits/tokens into the RC drop.
- Existing onboarding material (`docs/getting-started/*.md`, `docs/adoption/brownfield-guide.md`) cross-link to the release + migration docs for continuity.

## Known Follow-Ups

From Sprint 19 retrospectives ([docs/changelog/sprint-19.md](../changelog/sprint-19.md)):
1. Wrap Toast component state updates in `act()` for cleaner test output.
2. Add additional Tabs/Breadcrumbs edge-case stories + docs.
3. Validate performance under large pagination/tab counts and document metrics.

## Next Steps

- Sprint 20 missions (B20.1–B20.4) cover private RC build & freeze, reviewer kits, documentation refresh (this mission), and RC freeze/rollback planning (see `cmos/missions/backlog.yaml`).
- Mission B20.3 tracks doc updates + release comms; completion requires `./cmos/cli.py mission complete B20.3 --notes "..."` paired with a fresh `./cmos/cli.py validate health` run and telemetry review.
- Future releases will add MCP-powered workflows (agents panel, transcript/replay, policy enforcement) once the Sprint 20 queue clears.
