objective: >
  Implement Breadcrumbs with middle-item overflow menu, semantic landmarks, and HC-compliant visuals.

context: |
  R18.1 confirms industry consensus: breadcrumbs must collapse middle items into an overflow menu,
  reserve first/last items, and expose aria-label/aria-current semantics. This mission delivers the
  component, ensuring token-driven styling, keyboard support, and Storybook proofs across long/short
  hierarchies and HC scenarios.

successCriteria:
  - "Breadcrumbs renders nav landmark with aria-label='breadcrumb'; last item uses aria-current='page'."
  - "Overflow menu appears when items exceed width; retains first/last, keyboard accessible (tab/enter/space)."
  - "Tokens drive spacing, typography, link states; HC mode verified via forced-colors test."
  - "Storybook stories for short path, long path (overflow), internationalized labels; VR baselines updated."
  - "Unit tests cover overflow reduction logic, a11y attributes, tooltip/truncation if applied."

deliverables:
  - "Component: src/components/breadcrumbs/Breadcrumbs.tsx."
  - "Storybook: stories/components/Breadcrumbs.stories.tsx."
  - "Tests: tests/components/breadcrumbs.spec.tsx + axe/HC run."
  - "Docs update: docs/components/navigation.md (breadcrumbs section)."
