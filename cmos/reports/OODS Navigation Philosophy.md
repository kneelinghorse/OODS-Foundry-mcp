OODS Navigation Philosophy: A Strategic RealignmentThis report provides a comprehensive analysis of the OODS (Object-Oriented Design System) Foundry philosophy, derived from the provided GitHub repository context, and proposes a strategic restructuring of the navigation. The analysis confirms that the current navigation structure obscures the core value of OODS by prioritizing components over objects. The proposed hierarchy is designed to teach the OODS methodology, centering the narrative on Objects, Traits, and Contexts.1. Deep Dive: The OODS Foundry PhilosophyOODS Foundry is fundamentally different from traditional design systems. It is not merely a collection of UI components but an object-oriented, agent-native design system architecture.1 Its primary goal is to align the design system's abstractions directly with the business domain logic. The philosophy shifts the focus from the implementation details (components) to the essential concepts (objects).1.1. Core ConceptsObjects (The "What"): The central organizing principle of OODS.2 Objects represent real-world entities or concepts within the business domain (e.g., User, Product, Invoice, Organization). They are the nouns of the system and the heroes of the OODS narrative.Traits (The "Capabilities"): Small, reusable, and composable units of behavior and capability.3 Traits define what an object is or can do.4 Examples include Statusable (has a lifecycle status), Temporal (is timestamped), Addressable (has a location), Permissioned, and Approvable.Contexts (The "Where"): The environment in which an object is rendered.5 OODS recognizes that the same object must adapt its presentation based on where it appears. Canonical contexts include List, Detail, Form, Card, and Timeline.Primitives (The "Support"): The raw UI building blocks (Buttons, Inputs, Typography, Tables). In OODS, these are the supporting cast; they exist solely to facilitate the rendering of Objects within a specific Context.1.2. Key Differentiators and MechanismsThe Trait Engine: The core mechanism that manages "dependency-aware composition."6 It orchestrates how traits are applied to objects, resolving dependencies (e.g., Statusable might depend on Temporal) and enabling capability checking (e.g., statusRegistry). This engine is central to the OODS approach.Context Rendering (View Profiles): The system that dynamically renders objects based on their context. Utilizing mechanisms like RenderObject and predefined View Profiles, it allows a single object definition to manifest differently based on the required presentation.Semantic Architecture & Accessibility (A11y): OODS utilizes a structured token architecture (Reference → Semantic → Component).7 This semantic foundation inherently supports robust theming and ensures accessibility is a first-class concern, integrating ARIA patterns, High Contrast/ForcedColors support, and status-aware announcements.TEP Visualization System: The Token-Expression Pipeline (TEP) provides a structured, trait-based approach to data visualization. It uses normalized specs and adapters to ensure visualizations are accessible and renderer-agnostic.Agent-Native Design: The system is structured to be machine-readable, facilitating automation by AI agents for maintenance, documentation, and validation.82. Inventory and Gap Analysis (Tasks 1 & 2)The research objective requires analyzing the current state against the OODS philosophy. The analysis confirms the problem statement: the current navigation presents OODS backwards, leading with Primitives and obscuring the core concepts.OODS ConceptOODS ImportanceCurrent State (Inventory)Key Gaps in PresentationObjectsCentralUser, Org, Product. "Domains" (specialized objects).Not the hero. Buried under "Components." "Domains" are confusingly separated rather than integrated as specialized objects.TraitsFoundationalOnly Addressable visible.

Features exist (High Contrast, etc.).Presented as an afterthought, not as an integrated, first-class feature of the architecture.Viz System (TEP)DifferentiatorScattered viz stories.Shown as individual charts, failing to tell the story of a cohesive visualization system.Summary of Gaps: The documentation fails to teach the OODS model. It hides the unique engines (Trait and Context Rendering) and buries the differentiators (A11y and Visualization systems).3. Proposed OODS-Native Hierarchy (Task 3)The navigation must embody the OODS philosophy. The structure should guide the user through the mental model: Philosophy → Architecture/Mechanics → Realized Objects → Reference Details.Proposed Navigation Structure:1.
