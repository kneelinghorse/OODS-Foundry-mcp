title: Object Matrix MVP
status: Queued
sprint: Sprint 37
created: 2025-12-03
tags: [hero-demo, objects, contexts, navigation-phase-2]

objective: |
  Create a prominent "Object Matrix" demo that proves OODS's core value proposition:
  "The same object renders differently based on context, and traits add capabilities."

context: |
  INFRASTRUCTURE AUDIT FINDINGS:

  1. RenderObject already exists (src/components/RenderObject.tsx)
     - Takes object, context, data props
     - Supports 6 contexts: detail, list, form, timeline, card, inline
     - Auto-resolves trait extensions per context

  2. Context Gallery already exists (stories/proofs/context-gallery.stories.tsx)
     - Shows 3 objects × 6 contexts grid
     - Currently buried at "Proofs & Internals/Contexts/Domain Context Gallery"

  THIS IS A RELOCATION + ENHANCEMENT TASK, NOT BUILD-FROM-SCRATCH.

  Reference: cmos/reports/oods-navigation-implementation-plan.md (Part 4.2)

deliverables:
  - path: stories/objects/ObjectMatrix.stories.tsx
    action: create
    details: |
      Create a new story file that serves as the hero demo for Objects.

      APPROACH: Static 3×3 matrix proving the concept:

      ```
                 | Detail Context | List Context | Card Context |
      -----------+----------------+--------------+--------------+
      User       | [rendered]     | [rendered]   | [rendered]   |
      + Traits   | [rendered]     | [rendered]   | [rendered]   |
      Invoice    | [rendered]     | [rendered]   | [rendered]   |
      ```

      IMPLEMENTATION:
      1. Import RenderObject, existing object definitions, fixtures
      2. Create a static grid layout (CSS Grid)
      3. Show User, Subscription, Invoice across 3 contexts
      4. Add row/column headers explaining what's being demonstrated
      5. Optional: Show "User" vs "User with Addressable" comparison

      STORY TITLE: "Objects/Object Explorer/Matrix View"

      REFERENCE: stories/proofs/context-gallery.stories.tsx for patterns

  - path: stories/proofs/context-gallery.stories.tsx
    action: update
    details: |
      Update the title to relocate to the new hierarchy:

      BEFORE: title: 'Proofs & Internals/Contexts/Domain Context Gallery'
      AFTER:  title: 'Objects/Object Explorer/Full Context Gallery'

      This keeps the existing implementation but makes it discoverable
      in the Objects section.

success_criteria:
  - New ObjectMatrix.stories.tsx renders without errors
  - Shows 3 objects × 3 contexts in a clear grid
  - Context Gallery relocated to Objects section
  - Both stories visible in Storybook nav under "Objects/Object Explorer"
  - No regressions in existing functionality

validation:
  - command: pnpm storybook --smoke-test
    expected: Stories load without errors
  - manual: Navigate to Objects/Object Explorer in Storybook
  - manual: Verify Matrix View and Full Context Gallery both appear
  - manual: Verify grid renders correctly with all objects/contexts

dependencies:
  - B37.1 (verification must pass first)

estimated_effort: 1-2 hours

notes: |
  SCOPE GUARD: Do NOT build full interactivity (dropdowns, dynamic switching).
  The goal is visual proof of concept, not an interactive app.

  If this MVP proves the concept, Sprint 38 can add interactivity.

  DECISION FROM PLANNING SESSION:
  "The insight we're selling is simpler than the implementation implies.
   Start with static, prove the concept, then iterate."
