objective: >
  Implement Statusable components—Badge and Banner (Toast optional)—wired to enum→token mappings
  with full a11y semantics, reduced-motion support, and brand/theme/HC matrices.

context: |
  These primitives exercise intent mapping, contrast safety, and live-announce behavior. We centralize
  status→semantic token mapping and prove resilience in forced-colors and reduced-motion environments.

successCriteria:
  - "Central status map JSON used by all statusables; no local intent colors."
  - "Banner uses role='alert' for destructive/negative and role='status' for neutral/positive."
  - "Toast (if included) announces via aria-live='polite' and respects prefers-reduced-motion."
  - "Visible focus in HC; keyboard dismiss (Esc) and focus return."
  - "Story: status snapshot grid (all statuses × emphasis) establishes VR baseline."
  - "A11y tests for roles/announcements; Playwright spec verifies toast open/close announcements."

deliverables:
  - "Badge + Banner components; (optional) Toast."
  - "status-map.json and tokens references; stories (snapshot grid)."
  - "Unit tests for ARIA roles/associations; Playwright spec for toast."
  - "Docs: /docs/components/statusables.md."
