notes: |
  This sprint extracts useful tools from the designStudio fork and validates Design Lab features.
  Focus on Design Lab Shell, OODS Agent CLI, and structured data tooling.
  Storybook UI cleanup deferred to future sprint.
  designStudio folder will be removed after extracting needed tools.
