objective: >
  Create the EmptyState component with illustration/headline/body/action slots, tokenized spacing, and
  content guidelines per R18.1.

context: |
  Empty states are critical for first-run and no-data experiences. Research specifies canonical anatomy,
  token hooks (spacing, typography, color), and Statusables alignment for intent-based variants. This
  mission delivers the component, Storybook templates for common scenarios, and documentation to ensure
  consistency across domains.

successCriteria:
  - "EmptyState component supports illustration, headline, body, primary/secondary actions, and optional intent prop mapping to Statusables tokens."
  - "Spacing/typography driven via design tokens; layout responsive and accessible (headings, landmarks)."
  - "Storybook stories cover 'No Data', 'First Use', 'Success/Completion', with content guidance + MDX doc."
  - "Unit/snapshot tests ensure slot rendering + token classnames; axe check passes."
  - "Documentation includes copywriting checklist and illustration usage guidance."

deliverables:
  - "Component: src/components/empty-state/EmptyState.tsx."
  - "Storybook: stories/components/EmptyState.stories.tsx + MDX docs."
  - "Tests: tests/components/empty-state.spec.tsx."
  - "Docs: docs/components/empty-state.md (content + design guidance)."
